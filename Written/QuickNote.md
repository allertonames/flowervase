Hello Ritchie

As this Email contained the threat of retaliatory consequences. It was apparent that you were no longer a willing participant or acting in "good faith" to the contract.
There was also demonstrable disregard for procedures contained in the PRS code of conduct, therefore I accepted this as your **immediate** resignation as a responsible "letting agent" for 225 North Street.

As I have a duty of care to the tenants, I'm obliged to ensure I employ the use of a letting agent that will, as a minimum, follow a legally binding code of conduct.

Therefore since your abdication/resignation, the only contract I recognise as mutually agreeable representation is between the current tenant,  Haart (letting agent) & myself,  for 225 North Street LU2 7QH which started on the 2nd November with my email informing you of the immediate effect of the change.

Please kindly provide prompt assistance to Haart in transferring legal representation to them without any further delays or hesitation.

Please reply as soon as practicable indicating what your intentions are.


Kind regards

NickI
