I’m sure you have heard or said phrases like, 'In an ideal world' or 'in the real world' do you ever wonder which one you are in? 

There are numerous phrases in our common parlance that we accept, regardless of religion, race, creed, or perception that taken literally, show we at least live in a world with an invisible element to it, a holographic type universe or a multi-verse with potentially infinite densities or dimensions.

So far I've heard and/or said,

In an ideal world,
In the real world,
In the world that we live in,
Best of both worlds,
Beyond the veil,
Worlds apart,
It’s a small world..
(Can you suggest some more?)


We simply wouldn't have these phrases if there wasn't a seed of truth to them. 

In linguistics, terminology and phrases are built on what we experience, what's around us, our history, and our five senses. 

Even the phrase "a seed of truth" is an example it would not be found in societies that did not have a historical agricultural background.

Old supposedly fictional lyrics & literature have been extolling this alternative dream world as well.

Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream, merrily, merrily merrily, merrily life is but a dream!

Consider Shakespeare’s Midsummer Nights Dream carefully reminding us of this alternative world, for centuries.

Considering these ‘other worldly’ terminology and hints, I suggest we who have them in our common parlance had accesses to, or the specific knowledge of alternative dimensions or densities. 

How long ago this proof or knowledge was removed from our collective history is uncertain, but I am certain it is still available to those who seek it. I'm certain it was a deliberate action to conceal this information. I am also certain that this knowledge is so valuable, after deliberate concealment dedicated action would be taken to keep it alive, albeit secret at all costs. Motives and who is a mute point until you accept that this alternative reality layer is possible, then likely and eventually actual. 

Another world or reality layer is defiantly possible, to think this human based, 3D, 5 sense reality is all there is, is extremely closed minded and ignores basic scientific facts.  e.g. Some animals can see more of the light spectrum, can sense magnetic fields, can hear more sounds than humans. Even Plants have had ghost limbs and electromagnetic auras photographed by Harry Oldfield.

We’ve been talking about our symbiotic invisible world for centuries, we’ve had the “wool pulled over our eyes,” we can no longer see “beyond the veil” it’s the “Emperor’s new clothes” in reverse. 

Bare this in mind when you read, see, listen, how does the message change if you consider this different perspective.
