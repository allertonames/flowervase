I was also singled out to have special hearing tests, could I hear the frequency played through the headphones. I don’t recollect the results of these these were done before I left first school aged 9-10

Ok so these are hardly significant but it’s now I get the feeling there was more to it, I’m thinking it was a means of identifying the local poison container that would be open to being verbally controlled or as the next victim for the local ritual abusers. 

There was a couple of times where I would wet myself, once at another first school assembly and once in a first school small recorder class in the headmaster office. Was this me releasing the figrative posion I contained??
During those years I used to cry myself to sleep – this only was discovered when I went to stay with my cousins in my early teens we had to top and tail in a single bed and my cousin had to call my Auntie  as I was crying myself to sleep, again I didn’t know why when questioned– It must have been such a normal thing for me that I did it in that situation.

I also recollect when falling asleep sometimes not every time, I would get a very strange mind visuals again I only recollected this when I had exactly the same experience when falling asleep in my late 30s.
To describe it is difficult but it felt like I was zooming in and out down a tunnel vortex type thing it also had a body feel to it, the mind would lead and the body (spirit/soul) would follow. I do remember that I used to like that weird feeling as a child, was it means of protecting me from what might happen later  or was I being drugged for nefarious reasons. 

Maybe linked to what I could or could not hear I had there were a few times where I would loose control, consciousness and balance, the first one I remember was when a friend of the family was visiting I was on my trike, I blanked out and drove over the edge of the drive way falling down the 2 foot drop and getting a gash on my head, 2nd was riding my bike down the street a similar thing happened and I wobbled hit a kerb and went over the handle bars, both times the grown ups questioned me similarly to the Caretakers wife with face up close and great overly curiostiy – now Ive type this I recognize in my adult life a similar tense curiosity to my answer to particular questions.
There’s been other times I would drift off in class or at the Doctors and come round when specifically questioned as if the first thing I said was going to be a really significant answer. 

Like you I am certain something happened to cause this wounded child, fractured psyche but I don’t have any thing in a material sense to confirm this, it feels more like I was abused in the spirit world, in the dreaming. Or while I had been laced with LSD or something. I’ll get onto my recent dreams later.

Our adult lives do diverge a little but I also had big food issues but mine was over eating, big drug issues, a strong messiah complex, great difficulty talking to girls I found attractive, and great difficulty loosing my virginity. I still have this same weird body feeling and a bit of telepathy (increased if I smoke weed) which disables me to the point of embarrassing non communication.

I begin to wonder if the type of trauma in our past is so similar that it produced similar traits in our lives, perhaps I was not protected from “whatever” because my parents didn’t couldn’t love or protect me. 

In my adult life I’ve had some even more weird alomost super natural experiences but I don’t know if they have a significant bearing on the similarities I’m trying to convey so I’ll leave them until another time if appropriate. 
That being said I’ve been on a search to find out what the bloody hell has has happened both in my childhood and adult life.

It was only last month after more than 15 years of digging around the internet for something that is close to my experience I came across Eve Lorgen                      and what she calls the alien love bite, it does touch heavily into the realms of gnosticism and Archons and I recollect you are aware of this concept and are looking into something more terrestrial. But what she described in “the Higherside chat” podcast was pretty much spot on to my experiences. Maybe it’s not Archons but human actors with tech that can induce an alternative  reality and where pedophiles can indulge without the fear of ever being caught as it was literally in another dimension – Here I think of Saville and his untouchability and what some claim his magical abilities – remember that pictureof him in a semihypnotic robe. 

When I comes to talking to girls I found attractive I would get nervous and strong feelings inside – at first I thought thknightis was because I was a virgin and it would go once I got over those first initial nerves. But no they continue to this day. It was only last month that I first listened to Eve Lorgen, the feeling she described as the “love bite” were exactly the same as I got.
