For about 12-18 years in the first part of our life we are given as true 

Belief / knowing / truth / world view is a strange thing. 

How do you know what your world view is?

World view is the foundational knowledge I built upon, it was shaped from my upbringing, school, the TV programs I watched the peer groups I had. I like many carried with me the official narrative of history, science, social interactions, etc. 

I had the answers to Who are we, where do we come from, why are we here, and these are strongly entrained for on average 15 years until leaving full time education then loosely socially encourage after wards amongst my peer groups.

These world views were not self discovered but given and diversion from them are met with ridicule, shaming, ostricisation, but very rarely reasoning, facts, proof. 

This is how I was told to believe.

Where do we come from:
First was the big bang, everthing came from nothing in a fraction of a second and as it slowed down gravitational forces formed stars and planets. Microbial life in the primodial type soup started and over aeons life forms got more complex until complex life like monkeys which gradually developed into cave men and neandathals. Then hunter gathers in small villages banded together and eventually civilsation and cities. 
Civilisation happened around 6000 years the same time as the biblical story starts and there is criss cross weaving of the developing of the first major civilisation in eygpt and the first major religion of the jews. The greeks are menitoned but the focus is on the romans and the criss cross with the jews and then Jesus. 
The romans came to england gave us some civilisation and then it colapsed and the dark ages where we almost went back to the stone ages. 
Medievil times and knights the early british empire of world exploration discovering new lands conquring before we have the last few hundred years of a modern age

Why are we here?
Earth is unique no other planet like it bcause we are in the goldilocks zone by sheer chance life evolved and/or unique plant and god created us and only us and no others anywhere in the universe. 

To procreate – biological robots in a meaningless universe is one perspective – But with a western judeo-christian upbringing I always thought I had a soul/spirit and lived before and will live again and it was a mish mash of reincarnation cos I did bad so when I do good I will remain in a heaven type scenario

Who are we 
Biological robots or gods children? 

I appreciate these are great generalizations but these are still being taught but with greater refinements such as the out of africa model, new theroies on big bang with fast expansion and quick cooling into stablilty. 

Regardless of refinement we are still told to take these as the best and therefore the correct version by all the expersts aso don’t question.
