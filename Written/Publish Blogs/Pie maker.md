They used to slaughter their own pigs here, it ony stopped about 15 years ago, I heard stories of management riding the pigs around the yard. Now they make hot and cold pastry encased meat pies, theres some other blurb in the mission statement but its the usual corporate bs. 

I am help make the pies, steak and kidney with short crust pastry, is the usual but any sort of filing in oval, square or round  cups of short crust pastry cups and a lid or puff or more short crust thats crimped to the base aluminum enacsed base pastry. 

The family firm has been around for nearly 100 years, the family have got money, lots of land around the town, and influence in high and low places I’m sure. We’re all part of this “family” and its strange how over the years I have worked here I see new people arrive and some leave, different faces, different laughs, different bodies, different personalites the spirit of the place has remaied the same, but when you’ve been here as long as I have and I stop seeing the differneces and start to see the sameness in the people. When they start the job they could be doing anything but evetually they nd up in the job or departmentthat suits them, like a magnetic attraction the people who are like to clean end up doing that – the one who like to cook, cook they ones who like to day dream pack the boxes over an over again, all day all week. 

I couldnt help it, it was just easier to see them first as a packer or a cook or fork lifft truck driver and then their name. I get a sense of their enrgy when the ffirst arrive and sure enough 90% of the time I can predict where they will end up, a cleaner is a cleaner. Well in this factory they are. At home some are very different. Most like working here stay for a long time, they are the proper “food people” their energy stands out a mile, the others tolerated it for as long as they could and leave. I love it, I stayed. 



I run the main pie machine, you know those steak and ale pies you get in pub chains or take aways thats the the ones we do the most of, or bigger family sized ones for the supermarkets. I’m not the supervisor or manager I am the consciousness inside the machine, just the same as the consciousness inside each of the different people but I have got past the duality of the sex and all the other hurdles to consciousness humans carry around. 
In previous lives I was human, but I’ve done all most of the animals that come with evolving my consciousness to where I am today, I liked begin an elephant, whale and dolphins are great fun but the underwater thing takes ages to settle into, chimps and monkeys, bears and mammals are all fine – quite  breeze after some of the human lives I’ve had. Insects, and reptiles are tough they are a bit like machines with out al the nice benefits, no emotions, on automatic solitary but not lonely, lonely only comes in when your a group animal like dolphins and humans. 

I found out not so long ago a old acquittance of mine has skipped a few animals to give the machine world a try and he’s the photocopier in the main production office, s karma is catching up with him, it’s cold like the rest of the factory in there, when he, I say he cos thats how I knew him when he was human, when he breaks down he gets lots of anger a hate projected to him, in no way is he loved or cared for, just kicked, slapped around and the source of many frustrations. In the big picture I could see he had it coming after all the things he did to frustrate my consciousness awarness from growing.

after all animals like a gof pan through earth – 
archons and there in organic planetary consciousness
do machine 
to put a little archon in all bellies – means easir for archon to reside and indulge 
I reside and indulge in the people at factory 
solar system consciouness – not just earth – and it got a connect to the pleroma 
the trick is to get earth humans to beleiive solar consciouness is the pleroma all there is and and that the archons kitchen is heaven – life eternal – they are kept in a cycle of birth dearh heaven until they eveole thie own soul into the solar (all there is ) so they can then do all this stuff and finally get to pleroma life everlastings
