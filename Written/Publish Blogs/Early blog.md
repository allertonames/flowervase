Know thy Self 

Be yourself they say, Know thy self is the admonmission of the mystics

Boris Mouravieff boils it down to two which I found funny as I often hear the classic phrase – (it’s best said in a cockny accent like del boy)  “there's two type of people in this world – Rodney, those with and those without.”

The Apocryphon of John expands on this schema. Three main types and subset of those.

There are two types of Pneumatics: those who avoid the corruption of the flesh and those who do not. Both as saved. Then there are the Psychics, who have souls but are without spirit. They are repeatedly re-incarnated until they acquire the gnosis. Then they are saved. Last of all those without the gnosis (the Hylics?), who are damned eternally.

The pneumatic teachings were kept a secret because the spiritually immature can easily be so baffled that they dismiss them as incomprehensible nonsense….”

So all this distracting bullshit about our physicality our gender, biology, sexual orientation, and the numerous division that now split the gender unicorn!, (apparently there’s over 50),  That's before we get to personal beliefs like atheists, agnsotic, theist, antitheist and how we practice those beliefs. All this is basically meaningless and a materialistic distraction because in the biggest picture as these texts boil it down too, is do you have a soul or not? And if so are you doing something about it?

Those without the emphatic soul mimic and draw energy from those that do so as to progress in their materialistic world. 
Those with souls have them squashed, stamped on and made to believe their inner voice telling them there’s defiantly more to life than being a biological robot in a meaningless universe, is a form of mental disorder that they must be drugged and locked up for the good of the community.  Or many use alcohol, tobacco and recreational drugs to silence that higher self. 

With this game of souls played out by higher and lower entities each with “good and Bad” sides that have millenia of tricks, distractions, and misdirection the game is rigged like a mafia casino. We roll the dice wishing for lucky sevens but the actual game we’re in is roulette and it’s come up loser. 

I recall a few ooccasions visiting family or chatting to “friends” the conversation had overtures about sexuality - “not drinking thats Gay that is” “I was talking to someone and asked if there mother realised he was gay” the subtext was a bit piss poor – it said more about them than me there pusuit of it was as if they had a stake in that game. Betting on red or black but I had a naggin doubt and seemed to be playing poker. I’ve been searching for something more, that old game the game of black and white I s so last millenium  It was played out long ago in a previous life and both side can win and both can loose. 
The real quest is for the soul, Pnematic, Psychic or hylic? 

For most of my life I’ve been questionig aothority, a bit of rebel and a bit of a joker / fool -in the tarot its not a bad thing its a kin to a clean slate not burdened with dogma and tradition. I can cover some of my early life events later.
Around 10 years ago pressure built and something snapped  I’ve called it a rude awakening before but maybe I was already awake it was more a killing of the soul/higher self I’d had up to that point. 
Now on reflection I’m beginning to see that my old ego could well have been an implant of something like the alien love bite E lorgan talks about. 
It was those series of event that stimulated a searching for more info for anwswers to all thes nnew questions that had been presented. A few years passed books videos and talks fleshed out my knowledge but never got to the nitty gritty 

I thought I had a new set fo answers it was muddled and needed some tiding up, but it didn’t cover the highlevel weirdness and certainly didn’t make me feel better so I lapsed back into silencing the voices again. That was until I could break from the enviroment and slowly and surely new answers were being dicovered. The snippets of truths I had heard read or seen now had some corroboration a new foundation had been dug but nothing solid to build on yet. 

Now a new tug begins between growth and stagnation, I’m in the roads of trials and as so many have said the only proper way out is through other wise I’ll be like gazza or george best. 

I just don’t know I suspect I had very little empathy I mimiced behaviour I just didn’t care but that was before the RAWK was that the soul implant the synthetic ego my body hosted so I could be monitored and bet upon. Did it die and I saw the other side of the veil? Was numerous new implants tried out but none could over come the true underlying ego. 
Now I know I have more empathy I feel the cold shiver come over me even when I just hear of a nasty accident. But I don’t have empathy for some of these migrants – or is it just practicalities of the find refuge the first place you can not try to push to the fabled promised land based on their greed. 
I feel sorry and compassion for the homeless beggar with no legs but I’m too greedy and tight to give up even a few pence in aid. 

Mimic or oprressed soul – the quest and what might be a trueer heros journey goes on. 

Mmm the bigger Hjourny to know thy self, to connect with my higher or future self is probably purer than writing that book or screwing around.
