Commentary on Boris Mouravieff's Gnosis

As things "heat up" here on the Big Blue Marble, we have received much correspondence from individuals asking "what to do." The subject has even come up a number of times in the egroup discussions, and many of the old fears and turmoil have surfaced with ideas of pulling up roots and - for reasons of self-preservation - moving here or there or undertaking to follow this or that promoter of "methods of ascension" or methods of "fixing the planet" so that everybody can just "get along" or we can all snuggle up with some warm fuzzies and get some rest.

The reader who has surveyed the material on this site has surely come to the conclusion that what we are saying is "nothing is as it seems and never has been," including the many religions and "methods of ascension" promoted down through the ages.

But what is lacking is a clearly defined WAY that might give guidance to the seeker in his quest for the keys to his own "salvation" in whatever terms he might define it. I have worked on presenting the WAY in both the Wave Series and the Adventures series by sharing my own experiences and what I have gleaned from much study and research, but some readers are put off by material that deals with all the lies and deceptions that we face in our reality and simply want to read something "uplifting." It doesn't seem to occur to them that one cannot be "uplifted" as long as one is mired in quicksand. What seems to be true is that we live in a world of lies - ruled by lies and stealing - and that human beings lie because it is impossible for them to do otherwise. Without a Way, that is.

As a result of our own searching and questing for answers, the repeated trying and testing of sources and materials, little by little we have come to the idea of what NOT to do. But again, there has not been a whole lot about what TO DO.

The Cassiopaeans have indicated certain pathways to follow, but as always, we are more or less on our own in acquiring the knowledge and learning how to apply it - and for good reason, as the reader may know.

In recent months however, we have been surveying a body of teachings that not only meshes with, but vigorously expands upon the Cassiopaean Transmissions to an extent that we cannot think that it is accidental. In fact, the overlapping and "filling in the gaps" quality of this work is so astounding that we are certain that the Cassiopaeans themselves are very likely involved in this teaching in ways we do not understand.

The work in question is that of the Russian exile Boris Mouravieff, presented in his three part study and commentaries entitled Gnosis. Very little information is available on the background of these materials while a good deal of disinformation is circulating in other circles, and it is best to address these problems before we even attempt to present the material.

As it happens, during our research into Boris M., we discovered that he was being soundly lambasted by William Patrick Patterson in his book "Talking With the Left Hand" in which he accuses Mouravieff of "stealing" his ideas from Gurdjieff. Patterson is the author of four highly praised books on spiritual development and is a longtime student of John Pentland, the man Gurdjieff chose to lead the Gurdjieff Work in America, and the editor of The Gurdjieff Journal©, the only international quarterly devoted to exploring the "ancient teaching of the Fourth way brought and embodied by G. I. Gurdjieff."

Just in case the reader is not familiar with Gurdjieff, let me give a little background. Dating from his first lectures in Moscow and St. Petersburg in 1912, George Ivanovich Gurdjieff attracted the attention of occultists and many Western aristocrats. His teachings (often referred to as the 'Gurdjieff Work' or 'Fourth Way') became widely known through the writings and lectures of his pupil, the famous Russian mathematician and journalist Pyotr D. Ouspensky, and were later propagated by Alfred Orage, John G. Bennett, Rodney Collins, and Dr. Maurice Nicoll.

Gurdjieff himself admitted that he was utilizing 'stolen' teachings from a wide range of groups that he had encountered (including the Yezidis, the Russian Orthodox Church, and Sufi 'Bektashi' and 'Naqshbandi' sects in the Hindu Kush and Pamir regions) in his world travels. A deep study of Gurdjieff's work shows that he was obviously experimenting with his own ideas on how to utilize bits and pieces from these different teachings to create a system that would enable individuals to overcome ingrained "cognitive defects," become more conscious, and awaken the Higher Self's "Objective Conscience."

At a certain point, it seems that Gurdjieff realized that he had undertaken an impossible task since nearly all of his students "heard" only what they wanted to hear. He closed his school and concentrated on putting his ideas into allegory in his book Beelzebub's Tales To His Grandson (1950), which also incorporated and developed additional esoteric themes into his ideas.

Many of Gurdjieff's concepts have profoundly influenced our present culture due to the fact that some of his followers were famous and wealthy and had the means to promote them to others in the upper classes. After his death in 1949, Gurdjieff's legacy was disseminated through many people, and much of his work has been passed on through fragmentation of the many groups into something akin to secular denominations. One of the biggest problems with what happened to Gurdjieff's work - what seemed to be a sincere attempt to help humanity - was further obscured by the formation of what can only be called personality cults and identifications with Gurdjieff at the expense of his ideas. It seems that Gurdjieff himself saw this coming at the end of his life.

Groups that are offshoots of Gurdjieff's teachings have been known to use all kinds of things to reprogram their members, including isolation, group think, authoritarian power structures, and other psychological methods designed to unmask or break down the personal ego. But, what seems clear is that, in the case of Gurdjieff, no one group can claim the whole cheese since he was curiously selective about what he told whom, and even those who were closest to him obviously misunderstood what he was trying to convey, as evidenced by his own statements about this factor towards the end of his life.

Mouravieff tells us:

    People interested in esoteric matters will probably have read the book by P.D. Ouspensky, published posthumously, titled "In Search of the Miraculous: Fragments of an Unknown Teaching."  The ideas in that book were presented to Ouspensky by Georges Gurdjieff.  Gurdjieff indicates the basis of his teaching: "for the benefit of those who know already, I will say that, if you like, this is esoteric Christianity."

    Ouspensky's book - correctly indicated by the title - contains only fragments of a tradition which, until recently, was only transmitted orally.  And only a study of the complete tradition can give access to the revelation.  The system disclosed by the fragments that form Ouspensky's book and Gurdjieff's work, originates from revelations issued by the Great Esoteric Brotherhood to which the Apostle Paul alluded in his Epistle to the Romans: 

        We are assured and know that all things work together and are fitting into a plan for good to and for those who love God and are called according to design and purpose.  For those whom He foreknew, He also destined from the beginning to be molded into the image of His Son, that he might become the firstborn of MANY brethren.  And those whom He thus foreordained, He also called; and those whom He called, He also justified, made them righteous, and those whom He justified, He also glorified.

        What then shall we say to this:  If God is for us, who can be against us? [8;28-31]

    Boris Mouravieff asks: What should be the attitude of students towards the "Gurdjieff phenomenon" and Ouspensky's "Fragments"?

    The attentive reader will easily find the answer to that question himself in the contents of this article: we must begin by separating the message from the messenger, and we must look for the message beyond the level or information. This is the way to discover and eliminate error.

    In a myth well known in the Orient we are told that there exists a race of 'Royal Swans'. The fable adds that if we put milk mixed with water in front of one of them, it will separate out the milk and drink it, leaving the water. That must be the attitude of students.

        "Saint Gregory Palamas said the same when he wrote in his first Triad: "As for those people they call ‘theologians’ or ‘teachers,’ and think themselves able to borrow their theological terms, is it necessary even to mention them? Is it necessary that we keep away from "the light which lights every man who comes into the world," and wait for the terrible shadows of ignorance to illumine us, on the pretext that, just as serpents are useful, this is something useful for us? For the flesh of serpents is only useful to us if they have been killed, and cut up and used with reason as a remedy against their own bites. Those who kill them in this way turn a part of these snakes against themselves, just as if they had killed with his own sword a new Goliath, who had taken arms, who had set himself up to oppose us, who cursed the army of the living God - someone educated in divine things by sinners and illiterates."

The fact is, Gurdjieff faced great difficulties at the point in time when he sought to experiment with waking up humanity. As noted above, it was "Mission Impossible." However, what he and his followers did manage to do was to slash a trail through a jungle of lies and disinformation. It is not appropriate for his followers to insist that this bare trail is all there is and that there is no more. Rather, it is only logical to widen the trail, to pass through the gate revealed at the end of the trail, and discover what lies on the other side.

    "Lastly," said Mouravieff, "let those who have profited and are still profiting from the 'message' be sincerely grateful to the messenger and to the one who interpreted it. If they know how, let them pray for the salvation of their souls."

Nevertheless, William Patrick Patterson has penned rather harsh and unseemly accusations against Mouravieff - rather similar to our own experiences with Maynerd Most and Alvin Wiley - that need to be addressed. As it happens, a student of Mouravieff has done precisely that in an article entitled A response to William Patrick Patterson's criticism in his book "Taking with the Left Hand" by a student of Boris Mouravieff, Translated from the French by Theodore J. Nottingham, from which the following is excerpted:

    Patterson fails to bring forth the least fact, the least witness, the least clue, the least element of proof. He only states an opinion, his own, considering it of sufficient weightiness to confuse it with the truth.

    When Patterson writes: "Mouravieff's negative judgment of Gurdjieff rests on...the perception...Gurdjieff stole the teaching", the statement suggests that this is Mouravieff's perception, a purely subjective assumption leading to a serious accusation: stealing.

    In fact, Mouravieff reports the admission from Gurdjieff himself. He brings a testimonial and it is the testimonial of an admission. The minimal space given to this fact can be compared to the long developments which Patterson devotes to his own assumptions. On one side an admission, on the other suppositions. To which does Patterson give more attention? [...]

    Patterson's attitude reveals a classic psychological process. We can see several aspects of this: The first aspect is evoked by Patterson himself: "the projection onto the teacher". Indeed, it seems that certain individuals cannot approach the Knowledge without associating a name or a face to it. They "personalize" that which, in essence, is beyond all personalizing; and then emotion surpasses thought, that is, intelligence. [...] They focus their attention on the messenger instead of the message. This personalizing can take the acute form of veneration, not to say idolatry. Then, all questioning of their idol, even in the name of truth, is judged iconoclastic. The "blasphemer" must be punished -- that is, invalidated -- so that the worship of the idol may continue.

    The second aspect: he who identifies with the messenger finds himself inevitably wounded by the "attacks" (as they see them) against the idol. His personality, cut to the quick, will react. Pushed on by Nature -- which refuses all suffering -- it will fall back on the "self-tranquilizing machine".

    We know that, among the means used by the self-tranquilizing machine, there are two primary ones: the first is sentimentality toward oneself, self-pity, the second is accusation of the other. Each of these attitudes -- or both together as they generally form an "infernal couple" -- will calm, place a balm on the wound. And this will occur to the detriment of truth, replaced by justifications and rationalizations calling upon imagination whenever necessary. [...]

    This approach is close to being in bad faith, for instance in suggesting that Gnosis is "verbiage and lack of clarity and comprehension on the part of Mouravieff". This is proven wrong by many readers who "have commented on the clarity of the text" (preface of Gnosis II).

I would like to add here that we most thoroughly agree that Mouravieff's work is extraordinary in its clarity and completion of what was started by Gurdjieff, explaining much that Gurdjieff never explained, or if he did, those he explained it to either did not understand it, or sought to keep it secret so as to dispense it in controlled dollops to those they considered worthy (or who had enough money to pay for it.) Mouravieff's student goes on to say:

    He writes (without any proof by the way): "Mouravieff, an exiled aristocrat, had the typical sense of superiority over Russian émigrés he presumed to be socially inferior." "An aristocrat, intellectual and moralist, Mouravieff no doubt had trouble with Gurdjieff's unconventional behavior." It seems that Patterson could not imagine any other criteria to perceive others than through their social circumstances, as if a person could be reduced to a caricature.

    Patterson criticizes Mouravieff for stripping "Gurdjieff's teaching of its mooring in sacred science and insert it into an Eastern Orthodox Christian perspective..." And he adds peremptorily: "The two teachings simply didn't fit together."

I would like to note here that the work of Mouravieff provides that ineluctable bridge between the works of Gurdjieff, Ibn al-'Arabi, Carlos Casteneda, conjectured esoteric Christianity, hermeticism/alchemy and the Cassiopaeans. It should be noted that the Cassiopaeans have definitively supported the existence and work of a man around whom the Jesus legend formed - though they tell us that the story in the Bible that is supposed to be history is a myth - and here we find a body of teachings that lends background to this view, as well as supplemental information that elucidates the many clues offered by the Cassiopaeans. In our opinion, it is not only precipitate to reject Mouravieff's work, it is possibly suicidal. The comments of Mouravieff's student continue:

    And yet...! Is not the System of Octaves symbolized by the musical scale (tones and semitones) as well as by the notes that compose it (Dominus, Sidereus orbis, etc...). Is not the origin of these notes a Christian hymn to John the Baptist? Mouravieff reminds us of this in detail (Gnosis, chapter 10). He therefore responds, in preventive measure, to the issues raised by Patterson by showing that Christianity, including its European version, contained the System of Octaves at a certain period.

    Going back through Christianity to Judaism, Mouravieff points out the presence of the System in David's Psalm 118. Finally, there is no question that the Philokalia contains all the precepts of the Work and its "Christianity" need not be proven...

    Besides, Gurdjieff himself -- as Mouravieff reminds us -- made reference rather often to both monasteries and to Christian esotericism. And, other than questioning Mouravieff's witness -- that is, to call him a liar -- Gurdjieff stated to him that [Gurdjieff's] System "was the ABC of Christian doctrine".

    Mouravieff himself tells us that he learned the System "in 1920-21" in Constantinople through Ouspensky and Gurdjieff. This does not mean that Mouravieff did not follow other teachings, "Christian" teachings for example (see references in the manuscript INITIATION). On this last point, having no information, we can only ask questions: Did Mouravieff have Christian masters? Did they know the System? Or did Mouravieff study for himself "monuments such as the Philokalia", and discovered on his own the keys to the Gospels from Psalm 118?

    It would be an exceptional exploit of a self-taught person in a field where everyone claims the importance of an oral tradition.

    In saying that Ouspensky had "never been initiated in the oral Tradition other than through Gurdjieff", Mouravieff suggests that he personally had access to this oral Tradition among confirmed masters. But this can only be a deduction, based on our crediting the honesty of Mouravieff; there is no "objective" certainty.

    Whatever the case may be, we come out of these conjectures with the observation, which is now entirely objective, that Gnosis contains more information then [Ouspensky's] Fragments. Mouravieff evaluated the volume of supplementary material in Gnosis at one third more than those contained in Ouspensky's Fragments.

    How can Patterson explain that the copier knows more than the one copied, that the thief is richer than the one who is robbed?

    Certainly, one should analyze the nature of this additional material contained in Gnosis. Are these traditional teachings or ideas belonging to Mouravieff? It is also possible that Ouspensky, or his inheritors, did not reveal everything in Fragments.

    But Patterson does not mention the objective fact that Gnosis completes Ouspensky's revelations. Ouspensky's fragmentary message becomes, thanks to Mouravieff, an enlarged message "in the strict limits which are necessary and sufficient to enable the student to go further and in depth through his own creative efforts."

    Gurdjieff never clearly announced his goal: "I certainly have a goal...but my goal cannot mean anything to you at this time." What Gurdjieff does not reveal, Patterson miraculously knows and can confide to us: "Gurdjieff's mission was to establish the ancient teaching of the Fourth Way in the West as quickly as possible."

    On the other hand, what Patterson does not tell us is by whom was this mission given and in what way Gurdjieff was predisposed to accomplish it. Mouravieff does present certain unfortunate predispositions [about Gurdjieff] which are not favorable to the accomplishment of Gurdjieff's supposed mission:

        1) Gurdjieff is more the "sorcerer" type (hypnotist) than the teacher in the tradition of Socrates. Considering his type, his teaching activity was in great risk of being contaminated and parasited by the hypnotic influence that he "automatically" exerted over people.

        2) According to Mouravieff, Gurdjieff did not possess the intellectual talent to structure and shape the teaching. He had to rely on an intermediary -- Ouspensky. Mouravieff also has reservations on the oral expression [of Gurdjieff] which was sometimes brutal and insulting.

    Why did Gurdjieff hide his sources? Why does he remain silent on this subject, except in rare exceptional circumstances, such as that encounter with Mouravieff at the Cafe de la Paix: "I find the system at the foundations of the Christian doctrine. What do you say on this matter?" [asked Mouravieff of Gurdjieff]-- "It is the ABC," Gurdjieff answered me. "But they do not understand this!"

    Gurdjieff's silence regarding his sources gives birth to a suspicion: he is silent for a reason, because he follows a purely personal goal. This is the very opposite to the accomplishment of a mission. Why would one who fulfills a mission hide his sources? [A response to William Patrick Patterson's criticism in his book "Taking with the Left Hand" by a student of Boris Mouravieff Translated from the French by Theodore J. Nottingham]

In his book, Struggle of the Magicians, Patterson includes quotes on the front pages which say:

    The Magus is the highest that man can approach to God. G.I. Gurdjieff

    Toast to Gurdjieff: God give you the strength and the manhood to endure your lofty solitude. Rachmilevitch

    Gurdjieff is a kind of walking God - a planetary or even solar God. A.R. Orage

In response to these ideas, obviously dear to the heart of many Gurdjieff followers, including Patterson, let me just point out that Gurdjieff never accomplished the transmutation. He died just like everybody else.

Considering the fact that several other "seekers" were reputed to have transitioned without seeing death - Flamel and Fulcanelli among them - we might think that the only parts of Gurdjieff's work that should interest us are the parts that elucidate the work of the affirmed Masters. And frankly, Mouravieff has offered many clues that do, in fact, contribute to the body of alchemical/hermetic knowledge in a significant way.

So, in reading these many sources and comparing, we do have some chance of discerning the gems caught between the cracks in the pavement. Patterson has done himself and all other seekers a great disservice in his attacks on Mouravieff.

One of the things that really struck me when doing the research on Mouravieff was the following remark from the pages of the group - Praxis - that is promoting his books:

    The course studies the Christian Gnosis of Boris Mouravieff, exiled at the time of the Russian Revolution, who was a little-known 'third man' who before and after WWII, and taught and practiced the Fourth Way in its original Christian form.

This raised the hair on my head not only because of all the material I had found in Mouravieff's work that echoed the words of the Cassiopaeans, but because of the remark they had once made:

    07-19-97
    A: Laura, my dear, if you really want to reveal "many beautiful and amazing things," all you need to do is remember the triad, the trilogy, the trinity, and look always for the triplicative connecting clue profile. Connect the threes... do not rest until you have found three beautifully balancing meanings!!
    Q: So, in everything there are three aspects?
    A: And why? Because it is the realm of the three that you occupy. In order to possess the keys to the next level, just master the Third Man Theme, then move on with grace and anticipation.

And I can guarantee the reader that Mouravieff presents the keys to move on to the next level.

This brings us back to the issue of what we are supposed to DO in this day and age that is getting scarier by the minute. When I was at that stage myself, asking where should we do and what should we do, I was quite surprised when the C's responded that all of the running around to look for "safe places" was just "3D thinking" and that the only thing that counted was:

    "Who you are and WHAT YOU SEE."

This was expanded with a question about what are the lessons of 3D that we need to learn to "graduate" to 4 D:

    Q: (L) Well, how in the heck am I supposed to get there [graduate to 4th Density] if I can't "get it?"
    A: Who says you have to "get it" before you get there?
    Q: (L) Well, that leads back to: what is the wave going to do to expand this awareness? Because, if the wave is what "gets you there," what makes this so?
    A: No. It is like this: After you have completed all your lessons in "third grade," where do you go?
    Q: (L) So, it is a question of...
    A: Answer, please.
    Q: (L) You go to fourth grade.
    A: Okay, now, do you have to already be in 4th grade in order to be allowed to go there? Answer.
    Q: (L) No. But you have to know all the 3rd density things...
    A: Yes. More apropos: you have to have learned all of the lessons.
    Q: (L) What kind of lessons are we talking about here?
    A: Karmic and simple understandings.
    Q: (L) What are the key elements of these understandings, and are they fairly universal?
    A: They are universal.
    Q: (L) What are they?
    A: We cannot tell you that.
    Q: (L) Do they have to do with discovering the MEANINGS of the symbology of 3rd density existence, seeing behind the veil... and reacting to things according to choice? Giving each thing or person or event its due? [As the Sufis teach.]
    A: Okay. But you cannot force the issue. When you have learned, you have learned!

Curiously, this issue of what the individual can SEE was brought up in another context - that of discerning the character of very negative forces in our reality:

    Q: (L) Okay. Bundy described his murdering urges as a "pressure building inside" him that he couldn't overcome, and it seemed to cause him to stop being "human," as we think of it. That seems to me to be an example of an implant being able to overcome a person's social behavior, or controls over antisocial tendencies. Is this also what happened to the person who killed JO?
    A: Maybe.
    Q: (L) Is there a connection between the newly missing girl, CB, and JO?
    A: You are doing well in your probing of the knowledge within on this issue, we suggest continuance, after all, learning is fun!
    Q: (L) So, it seems to me that there was a connection between the appearance of CB and JO. Could it be that the individual who killed one or both of them was programmed to respond to this particular type facial characteristic? Could that be part of the programming?
    A: End subject.
    Q: (L) What do you mean?
    A: We have helped you all that is necessary for now on this matter. It is beneficial for you to continue on your own for growth.
    Q: (L) Can I ask just one or two more LITTLE questions in a different direction? I mean, this is like walking away and leaving me in the dark!
    A: No it is not!
    Q: (L) I would like to be able to solve this because the families are in pain and have asked for help.
    A: Why don't you trust your incredible abilities? If we answer for you now, you will be helpless when it becomes necessary for you to perform this function on a regular basis, as it will be!!!!
    Q: (L) Well, frankly, I don't want to be involved in any more murder investigations. It is too upsetting. Am I supposed to DO this sort of thing regularly???
    A: Not same arena.
    Q: (L) Well, then how do you mean "perform this function?"
    A: No, seeing the unseen.

I would like to ask the reader to please note that the C's indicated that "seeing the unseen" would be a necessary function and that being unable to do it would leave me (and anybody else on the path!) "helpless." This takes us back to "who you are and what you SEE," and leads to another important point:

    C's: Beware of disinformation. It diverts your attention away from reality thus leaving you open to capture and conquest and even possible destruction. Disinformation comes from seemingly reliable sources. It is extremely important for you to not gather false knowledge as it is more damaging than no knowledge at all. Remember knowledge protects, ignorance endangers. The information you speak of, Terry, was given to you deliberately because you and Jan and others have been targeted due to your intense interest in level of density 4 through 7 subject matter. You have already been documented as a "threat." [...] Remember, disinformation is very effective when delivered by highly trained sources because hypnotic and transdimensional techniques are used thereby causing electronic anomalies to follow suggestion causing perceived confirmation to occur.

So, let's get on with it: learning to See the Unseen with the help of the work of Mouravieff.

In the following sections, I will be quoting heavily from Mouravieff's books, including the introductions, but often with the insertion of "modern terms" at certain points, or terms which will make the excerpts more comprehensible to those who have not delved deeply into such studies. It is my hope that this condensation will inspire the readers to not only read the works of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky and Mouravieff, but that it will provide a broader framework for understanding the many articles and sessions files of Cassiopaean Transmissions published on this website.

    Boris Mouravieff's trilogy "Gnosis," is an attempt to recover and describe, in terms understandable to modern man, a particular Tradition handed down over the centuries, in a sometimes broken line, but one that still exists today in the Eastern Orthodox Church.  This tradition could be said to be the Christian equivalent of Yoga, Zen, and the other inner traditions of the far Eastern religions, disciplines, which have each existed as specializations within the religion of which they are a part.

    It is not one man's system or invention, but has its roots far back in the history of Christianity - whose roots lie in certain statements of St. Paul, and perhaps even of Christ himself.  Their development can be traced first through formative figures of the early churches, and it clearly relates to the doctrines expressed in the key texts of Eastern spirituality such as the Philokalia.

    It clearly relates the oral tradition known as the Royal Way that survives to this day in the main centers of monasticism in the Eastern church.  But it does not claim to be a work of Orthodox theology, nor to reinterpret Orthodox doctrine.

    Mouravieff admits that the survival of this tradition within the church is tenuous, that the doctrine does not appear to survive in full or has not been collected together in full.  Monks on Athos admit the existence of the Tradition but say that it has never been fully spelled out in writing.  The importance of Mouravieff's work is the effort he has made to collect that dispersed information and to make it accessible in practical form.

    What are the sources of Mouravieff's knowledge?  It is clear that his text consists of knowledge of a high order.

    There are several ways in which the accuracy of a text can be verified, and Mouravieff's stands up to all these methods of assay.  First of all, it fits the Orthodox tradition as expressed by those who still possess the Royal Way.  It evokes the confirmation of inspiration described in Plato's seventh letter.  It predicts, in what appears at first to be mere theory, the actual events of the life in the study of Gnosis.  It stands the test of practice, and in doing so it remains internally consistent.  When it does introduce ideas from other traditions, such as the concept of karma, it does so in ways that, properly understood, remain consistent to the overall statement of the doctrine with a degree of precision equal to that of the mature external sciences.

    Those who can discriminate between different levels of knowledge will find in Mouravieff and almost inexhaustible treasury of knowledge that can lead to true spiritual transformation.  But it is necessary first to work for this discrimination.  Without it, not only will you be unable to differentiate between gnosis and its imitations, but even Mouravieff's work will not release its gnosis to you in trust.

    The idea of esotericism is often misunderstood.  The clue can be found in the Gospel of Saint John:  "I am the vine, ye are the branches: he that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing."

    The word translated "without," the Greek "choris," quite definitely means "outside."  What this means is that in those times there was an inner knowledge, based on assenting to traditional knowledge - gnosis - which is then confirmed experimentally through techniques of inner observation, and a purely external kind of knowledge, gained through the ordinary senses.

    Constantine Cavarnos confirmed that there is an exoteric and esoteric Christianity:

    "The first kind of philosophy, external philosophy, comprises for them ancient Greek philosophy and the pagan philosophy of early Christian centuries.  The second kind, "internal philosophy," is identical with the [true] Christian religion." [The Hellenic Christian Philosophical Tradition," Institute for Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies, Belmont, MA, 1989. p. 109, quoted in the introduction to Mouravieff's "Gnosis II]

    Over the years, this esotericism has formed a Tradition, a science, or discipline of knowledge which may have existed before the time of Christ, but which has since been totally assimilated to the inner meaning of Christianity.  Boris Mouravieff says that "This Tradition, which in Antiquity was only revealed in the Mysteries under the seal of absolute secrecy." 

Under the influence of self-proclaimed initiates of The Tradition such as Guenon and Schwaller, Mouravieff has unfortunately adopted the idea that this Tradition passed from Egypt to Judaea and thus to Christianity. However what is clear is that the True Tradition of the Eleusinian mysteries is behind Christianity, and it was the Egyptian Tradition that became the false teaching that corrupted and distorted the work of the man we have come to know as Jesus. It is only in more recent times, with much additional research, including that of Pincknett and Prince in The Stargate Conspiracy, that we are even able to separate these threads and come to this understanding. So, Mouravieff cannot be criticized on this score.

In Manly Hall's exhaustive compendium, The Secret Teachings of All Ages, we find mention of the fact that St. Irenaeus was complaining about the efforts to compare Christianity to the religion of the Egyptians which included the death and resurrection of Osiris/Horus.  Irenaeus had some other interesting things to say about this, as Hall points out:

    "According to popular conception, Jesus was crucified during the thirty-third year of His life and in the third year of His ministry following his baptism. About AD 180, St. Irenaeus, Bishop of Lyons, one of the most eminent of the ante-Nicene theologians, wrote Against Heresies, an attack on the doctrines of the Gnostics. In this work, Irenaeus declared upon the authority of the Apostles themselves that Jesus lived to old age. To quote:

        'They, however, that they may establish their false opinion regarding that which is written, maintain that He preached for one year only, and then suffered in the twelfth month. [In speaking thus], they are forgetful of their own disadvantage, destroying His whole work, and robbing Him of that age which is both more necessary and more honourable than any other, that more advanced age, I mean, during which also as a teacher He excelled all others. For how could He have had His disciples, if He did not teach? And how could He have taught unless He had reached the age of a Master?

        For when He came to be baptised, He had not yet completed His thirtieth year, but was beginning to be about thirty years of age; and, according to these men, He preached only one year reckoning from His baptism. On completing His thirtieth year He suffered, being in fact still a young man, and who had by no means attained to advanced age.

        Now, that the first stage of early life embraces thirty years, and that this extends onward to the fortieth year, every one will admit; but from the fortieth and fiftieth year a man begins to decline towards old age, which Our Lord possessed while He still fulfilled the office of a Teacher, even as the Gospel and all the elders testify; those who were conversant in Asia with John, the disciple of the Lord, affirming that John conveyed to them that information. And He remained among them up to the time of Trajan.

        Some of them, moreover, saw not only John, but the other apostles also, and heard the very same account from them, and bear testimony as to the validity of the statement. Whom then should we rather believe? Whether such men as these or Ptolemaeus, who never saw the apostles, and who never even in his dreams attained to the slightest trace of an apostle?"

Well, obviously, this "Gospel" that Irenaeus refers to as testifying that Jesus did not suffer and die has disappeared! It could be among those of the library of Nag Hammadi. But, commenting on the foregoing passage, theologian Godfrey Higgins remarks that it has fortunately escaped the hands of those destroyers who have attempted to render the Gospel narratives consistent by deleting all such statements. He also notes that the doctrine of the crucifixion was a vexata questio among Christians even during the second century.

    "The evidence of Irenaeus, " he says, "cannot be touched. On every principle of sound criticism, and of the doctrine of probabilities, it is unimpeachable." [Anacalypsis, Godfrey Higgins, London, 1836, quoted by Manly P. Hall]

The fad for all things "Egyptian" has been with us for a very long time.  Schwaller de Lubicz - the vector of many of these ideas - settled in Egypt in 1938 and for the next 15 years studied the symbolism of the temples, particularly Luxor, finding what he considered to be proof that the ancient Egyptians were the ultimate examples of Synarchy, because the were ruled by a group of elite initiates.  He failed to point out that the Egyptian civilization was static and limited.  What's more, it caved in on itself, and never managed to produce any significant work of benefit for humanity, as Otto Neugebauer showed conclusively in his "The Exact Sciences in Antiquity."

The open-minded thinker ought to really consider the purported mysteries of Egypt in terms of the fact that they were so ignorant that they devoted a huge amount of energy to their "cult of the dead."  The whole Egyptian shtick is focused around preserving dead flesh for future or otherworldly reanimation.  The very fact that there are so many of these dead bodies for Egyptologists to dig up is the clearest evidence that the Egyptian beliefs were nonsense.

The whole issue of the excitement over Egyptian civilization is the belief that they had some power to control the forces of life because they built the pyramids and we can't.  And has it never occurred to anybody that the existence of the pyramids in conjunction with the worship of an elite group of human beings, while everybody else was wearing loincloths and sweating in the hot sun, might suggest a relationship between the two?  The fact is, the Egyptian civilization seems to have been the chief example of a vast chasm between the haves and the have-nots, and they managed to do it longer than anybody else.

In examining the work of Schwaller, we have one of the better examples of the subtle way the negative occult societies attack those who come to bring light, by association and co-opting.  The tactic is to find a means of subtly allying their message with that of the truly Positive so as to generate confusion in untrained minds which would tend on surface evidence to accept these actually contrary messages as similar, at least in intent.

The negative occultists who are promoting the new Control System borrow all their components from what is of truth, and proceed by the method of imitation.  They literally will ape the expression of positive teachings, and all the more carefully when they wish to be mistaken altogether for purveyors of truth, so as to subvert the messages.

Their usual strategy is to begin by adhering so closely to the truth as to be virtually indistinguishable to all but heightened, thinking awareness.  They install their ideas through the rhythmic lull of entrainment so as to catch the "congregation" totally off guard when they finally diverge slightly or greatly from the truth and so pull the listener along with them.  The voice of deception is, of course, all the more ingratiatingly imitative of "goodness" where it is addressing a listener who is truly desirous of seeking truth; those who are lazy to begin with don't need such careful wording to deceive them as they are already willing to be deceived.

And so it was that Mouravieff, under the influence of the Synarchists of his day, introduced some of their ideas into his own synthesis of the authentic Tradition, including the idea that the Tradition was passed from Egypt to Judaea via Moses.

What seems to be the Truth is that the Tradition came from the North, the fabled land of the Hyperboreans, via Orpheus and Pythagoras.

Accounts of the travels and studies of Pythagoras differ, but most historians agree that he visited many countries and studied at the feet of many masters. Supposedly, after having been initiated into the Eleusinian mysteries, he went to Egypt and was initiated into the Mysteries of Isis. He then traveled to Phoenicia and Syria and was initiated into the Mysteries of Adonis. After that, he traveled to the valley of the Euphrates and learned all the secrets of the Chaldeans still living in the area of Babylon. Finally, he traveled to Media and Persia, then to India where he was a pupil and initiate of the Brahmins there. Sounds like he had all the bases covered.

Pythagoras was said to have invented the term "philosopher" in preference to the word "sage" since the former meant one who is attempting to find the truth, and the latter means one who knows the truth. Apparently Pythagoras didn't think he had the whole banana.

Pythagoras started a school at Crotona in Southern Italy and gathered students and disciples there whom he supposedly instructed in the principles of the secrets that had been revealed to him. He considered mathematics, music and astronomy to be the foundation of all the arts and sciences. When he was about sixty years old, he married one of his disciples and had seven children. I guess he was a pretty lively senior citizen! His wife was, apparently, quite a woman in her own right and she carried on his work after he was assassinated by a band of murderers incited to violence by a student whom he refused to initiate. The accounts of Pythagoras' murder vary. Some say he and all his disciples were killed, others say that he may have escaped because some of his students protected him by sacrificing themselves and that he later died of a broken heart when he realized the apparent fruitlessness of his efforts to illuminate humanity.

The experts say that very little remains of the teachings of Pythagoras in the present time unless it has been handed down in secret schools or societies. And, naturally, every secret society on the planet claims to have this "initiated" knowledge to one extent or another. It is possible that there exists some of the original secret numerical formulas of Pythagoras, but the sad fact is that there is no real evidence of it in the writings that have issued from these groups for the past millennium. Though everyone discusses Pythagoras, no one seems to know any more than the post-Pythagorean Greek speculators who "talked much, wrote little, knew less, and concealed their ignorance under a series of mysterious hints and promises." There seems to be a lot of that going around these days! Even Plutarch did not pretend to be able to explain the significance of the geometrical diagrams of Pythagoras. However, he did make the most interesting suggestion that the relationship which Pythagoras established between the geometrical solids and the gods was the result of images seen in the Egyptian temples. And that, of course, could be misleading.

Albert Pike, the great Masonic symbolist, also admitted that there were many things that he couldn't figure out. In his Symbolism for the 32nd and 33rd degrees he wrote:

    I do not understand why the 7 should be called Minerva, or the cube, Neptune. ...Undoubtedly the names given by the Pythagoreans to the different numbers were themselves enigmatical and symbolic - and there is little doubt that in the time of Plutarch the meanings these names concealed were lost. Pythagoras had succeeded too well in concealing his symbols with a veil that was from the first impenetrable, without his oral explanation.

Manly Hall writes:

    This uncertainty shared by all true students of the subject proves conclusively that it is unwise to make definite statements founded on the indefinite and fragmentary information available concerning the Pythagorean system of mathematical philosophy.

With what little we have examined thus far, we are beginning to realize how true this latter remark is. Of course, in the present time, there is a whole raft of folks who don't let such remarks stop them. Any number of modern gurus claim to have discovered the secrets of "Sacred Geometry!" Not only that, they don't seem to have even studied the matter deeply at all, missing many of the salient points that are evident in the fragments of Pythagorean teachings. Regarding this, there is a passage in Foucault's Pendulum, by Umberto Eco, that explicates the problem:

    Amid all the nonsense there are some unimpeachable truths... I invite you to go and measure [an arbitrarily selected] kiosk. You will see that the length of the counter is one hundred and forty-nine centimeters - in other words, one hundred-billionth of the distance between the earth and the sun. The height at the rear, one hundred and seventy-six centimeters, divided by the width of the window, fifty-six centimeters, is 3.14. The height at the front is nineteen decimeters, equal, in other words, to the number of years of the Greek lunar cycle. The sum of the heights of the two front corners is one hundred and ninety times two plus one hundred and seventy-six times two, which equals seven hundred and thirty-two, the date of the victory at Poitiers. The thickness of the counter is 3.10 centimeters, and the width of the cornice of the window is 8.8 centimeters. Replacing the numbers before the decimals by the corresponding letters of the alphabet, we obtain C for ten and H for eight, or C10H8, which is the formula for naphthalene.

    ...With numbers you can do anything you like. Suppose I have the sacred number 9 and I want to get the number 1314, date of the execution of Jacques de Molay - a date dear to anyone who professes devotion to the Templar tradition of knighthood. ...Multiply nine by one hundred and forty-six, the fateful day of the destruction of Carthage. How did I arrive at this? I divided thirteen hundred and fourteen by two, by three, et cetera, until I found a satisfying date. I could also have divided thirteen hundred and fourteen by 6.28, the double of 3.14, and I would have got two hundred and nine. That is the year Attalus I, king of Pergamon, ascended the throne.

    You see? ...The universe is a great symphony of numerical correspondences... numbers and their symbolisms provide a path to special knowledge. But if the world, below and above, is a system of correspondences where tout se tient, it's natural for the [lottery] kiosk and the pyramid, both works of man, to reproduce in their structure, unconsciously, the harmonies of the cosmos. [Eco]

The idea has been promoted with great vigor for over a thousand years that so-called Kabbalists and "interpreters of mysteries" can discover with their incredibly tortuous methods The Truth, completely misses the point of a truth that is far more ancient: Mathematics is the language of Nature. The Pythagoreans declared arithmetic to be the mother of the mathematical sciences. This idea was based on the fact that geometry, music, and astronomy are dependent upon arithmetic, but arithmetic is not dependent upon them. In this sense, geometry may be removed but arithmetic will remain; but if arithmetic be removed, geometry will be eliminated. In the same way, music depends on arithmetic. Eliminating music affects arithmetic only by limiting one of its expressions.

Why do we think that Esoteric Christianity is related to the ancient Eleusinian mysteries?

The cult of Demeter which celebrated the Eleusinian rites was well established in Mycenaea in the 13th century BC, and it is more than likely that the Feast of Tabernacles in Canaan was an offshoot of this activity. Our sources of information regarding the Eleusinian Mysteries include the ruins of the sanctuary there; numerous statues, bas reliefs, and pottery. We also have reports from ancient writers such as Aeschylos, Sophocles, Herodotus, Aristophanes, Plutarch, and Pausanias - all of whom were initiates - as well as the accounts of Christian commentators like Clement of Alexandria, Hippolytus, Tertullian, and Astorias, who were critics and not initiates. Yet for all this evidence, the true nature of the Mysteries remains shrouded in uncertainty because the participants were remarkably steadfast in honoring their pledge not to reveal what took place in the Telesterion, or inner sanctum of the Temple of Demeter. To violate that oath of secrecy was a capital offense. For these reasons,scholars today must make use of circumstantial evidence and inferences, with the result that there is still no consensus as to what did or did not take place.

Many experts have concluded - probably erroneously - that the Mysteries at Eleusis originally must have come from Egypt. The fact is, the sanctuary ruins in Eleusis evidently go back centuries earlier than the Egyptian Hymn to Demeter recited by Homer that is often cited as the proof that the origin was Egyptian. What is more, the excavations have unearthed no Egyptian artifacts there from that period.

Many scholars today favor the view that the cult of Demeter probably derived from Thessaly or Thrace. They base this conclusion partly on references in Homer and other ancient authors to some evidently pre-Dorian temples to Demeter in the Thessalian towns of Thermopylae, Pyrasos, and Pherai; partly on certain etymological links connecting key words in the rites of Demeter to pre-Hellenic dialects from the north . Other scholars point out that Demeter may be the same as a goddess "Dameter," who is mentioned briefly in Linear B tablets from Pylos dating from approximately 1200 BC. This evidence suggests that the cult of Demeter may after all have originated in the southern Peleponnesus.

In any case, whether the specific cult of Demeter at Eleusis originated in northern or southern Greece, the undeniable parallels with worship of grain goddesses in other parts of the eastern Mediterranean region point to frequent contacts and the cross-fertilization of religious ideas. And we certainly think that the Canaanite Feast of Tabernacles was a corrupted version of some more ancient form.

As it happens, the term "Thesmophoria" is derived from thesmoi, meaning "laws," and phoria, "carrying," in reference to the goddess as "law-bearer." But the symbolism of the ark as the "law bearer" in the "tent of meeting," or the "Mother-Delta," the "doorway to the higher realms," replaced the original meaning and the role of women in the process. Based on our own researches, we believe that True Christianity - which is almost virtually unknown today - was a resurgence of a very ancient Tradition - and that this same Tradition was preserved, in part, in Shamanic lore, was part of the Cathar beliefs as well as the true meaning of the Grail legends.

Jessie L. Weston writes in From Ritual to Romance:

    The more closely one studies pre-Christian Theology, the more strongly one is impressed with the deeply and daringly spiritual character of its speculations, and the more doubtful it appears that such teaching can depend upon the unaided processes of human thought, or can have been evolved from such germs as we find among the supposedly 'primitive' peoples... Are they really primitive? Or are we dealing, not with the primary elements of religion, but with the disjecta membra of a vanished civilization?

    Certain it is that so far as historical evidence goes our earliest records point to the recognition of a spiritual, not of a material, origin of the human race. Students of the Grail literature cannot fail to have been impressed by a certain atmosphere of awe and mystery which surrounds that enigmatic Vessel. There is a secret connected with it, the revelation of which will entail dire misfortune on the betrayer. [...] It is so secret a thing that no woman, be she wife or maid, may venture to speak of it. [...]

    There is no doubt that the Grail was something secret, mysterious and awful, the exact knowledge of which was reserved to a select few. […] The Nature Cults still remain reliable guides; it is their inner, their esoteric, ritual which will enable us to bridge the gulf between what appears at first sight the wholly irreconcilable elements of Folk-tale and high Spiritual mystery."

In our work on Noah, we have tracked the Grail legends back to prehistoric times - in Western Europe and Central Asia - via the very area emphasized in many other ancient myths, including that of Jason and the Argonauts: Colchis and the Caucasus regions. Mircea Eliade writes:

    Recent researches have clearly brought out the "shamanic" elements in the religion of the paleolithic hunters. Horst Kierchner has interpreted the celebrated relief at Lascaux as a representation of a shamanic trance. The same author considers that the "kommandostabe" - mysterious objects found in prehistoric sites - are drumsticks. If this interpretation is accepted, the prehistoric sorcerers would already have used drums comparable to those of the Siberian shamans.

    Finally, Karl J. Narr has reconsidered the problem of the "origin" and chronology of shamanism in his important study. He brings out the influence of notions of fertility (Venus statuettes) on the religious beliefs of the prehistoric North Asian hunters; but this influence did not disrupt the paleolithic tradition. His conclusions are as follows: Animal skulls and bones found in the sites of the European Paleolithic (before 50,000 - ca. 30,000 BC) can be interpreted as ritual offerings. [...] Soon afterward, probably about 25,000 BC, Europe offers evidence for the earliest forms of shamanism (Lascaux) with the plastic representations of the bird, the tutelary spirit, and ecstasy. [...]

    What appears to be certain is the antiquity of "shamanic" rituals and symbols. It remains to be determined whether these documents brought to light by prehistoric discoveries represent the first expressions of a shamanism in statu nascendi or are merely the earliest documents today available for an earlier religious complex, which, however, did not find "plastic" manifestations (drawings, ritual objects, etc) before the period of Lascaux.[…]

    Everywhere in those lands, [ in Central and North Asia,] and from the earliest times, we find documents for the existence of a Supreme Being of celestial structure, who also corresponds morphologically to all the other Supreme Beings of the archaic religions. The symbolism of ascent, with all the rites and myths dependent on it, must be connected with celestial Supreme Beings; we know that "height" was sacred as such, that many supreme gods of archaic peoples are called "He on high," or "he of the Sky," or simply "Sky." This symbolism of ascent and "height" retains its value even after the "withdrawal" of the celestial Supreme Being - for, as is well known, Supreme Beings gradually lose their active place in the cult, giving way to religious forms that are more "dynamic" and "familiar" (the gods of storm and fertility, demiurges, the souls of the dead, the Great Goddesses, etc.) […]

    The reduction or even the total loss in religious currency of uranian Supreme Beings is sometimes indicated in myths concerning a primordial and paradisal time when communications between heaven and earth were easy and accessible to everyone; as the result of some happening, these communications were broken off and the Supreme Beings withdrew to the highest sky.[…    insert Saturn theory how it withdrew

The disappearance of the cult of the celestial Supreme Being did not nullify the symbolism of ascent with all its implication. […] The shamanic ecstasy could be considered a reactualization of the mythical illud tempus when men could communicate in concreto with the sky. It is indubitable that the celestial ascent of the shaman is a survival, profoundly modified and sometimes degenerate, of this archaic religious ideology centered on faith in a celestial Supreme Being and belief in concrete communications between heaven and earth. […] The myths refer to more intimate relations between the Supreme Beings and shamans; in particular, they tell of a First Shaman, sent to earth by the Supreme Being or his surrogate to defend human beings against diseases and evil spirits.

    This historical change in the religions of Central and North Asia […] in turn altered the meaning of the shaman's ecstatic experience. Descents to the underworld, the struggle against evil spirits, the increasingly familiar relations with "spirits" that result in their "embodiment" or in the shaman's being "possessed" by "spirits," are innovations, most of them recent. In addition, there are the influences from the south, which appeared quite early and which altered both cosmology and the mythology and techniques of ecstasy. Among these southern influences we must reckon, in later times, the contribution of Buddhism and Lamaism, added to the Iranian and, in the last analysis, Mesopotamian influences that preceded them.

    The initiatory schema of the shaman's ritual death and resurrection is likewise an innovation, but one that goes back to much earlier times; in any case, it cannot be ascribed to influences from the ancient Near East. But the innovations introduced by the ancestor cult particularly affected the structure of this initatory schema. The very concept of mystical death was altered by the many and various religious changes effected by lunar mythologies, the cult of the dead, and the elaboration of magical ideologies.[including Egyptian]

    Hence we must conceive of Asiatic shamanism as an archaic technique of ecstasy whose original underlying ideology - belief in a celestial Supreme Being with whom it was possible to have direct relations by ascending into the sky - was constantly being transformed by a ongoing series of exotic contributions culminating in the invasion of Buddhism.

    The concept of mystical death, furthermore, encouraged increasingly regular relations with the ancestral souls and the "spirits," relations that ended in "possession." The phenomenology of the trance underwent many changes and corruptions, due in large part to confusion as to the precise nature of ecstasy. Yet all these innovations and corruptions did not succeed in eliminating the possibility of the true shamanic ecstasy.

    More than once we have discerned in the shamanic experience a "nostalgia for paradise" that suggests one of the oldest types of Christian mystical experience. As for the "inner light," which plays a part of the first importance in Indian mysticism and metaphysics as well as in Christian mystical theology, it is already documented in shamanism.

    But shamanism is important not only for the place that it holds in the history of mysticism. The shamans have played an essential role in the defense of the psychic integrity of the community They are preeminently the antidemonic champions; they combat not only demons and disease, but also the black magicians. [A shaman is a] tireless slayer of demons. The military elements that are of great importance in certain types of Asian shamanism (lance, cuirass, bow, sword, etc.) are accounted for by the requirements of war against the demons, the true enemies of humanity. In a way it can be said that shamanism defends life, health, fertility, the world of "light," against death, diseases, sterility, disaster, and the world of "darkness."[...]

    What is fundamental and universal is the shaman's struggle against what we could call "the powers of evil." […] The shaman's essential role in the defense of the psychic integrity of the community depends above all on this: men are sure that one of them is able to help them in the critical circumstances produced by the inhabitants of the invisible world. […] A member of the community is able to see what is hidden and invisible to the rest and to bring back direct and reliable information from the supernatural worlds.[…]

    We have already referred to the likenesses between the accounts of shamanic ecstasies and certain epic themes in oral literature. The shaman's adventures in the other world, the ordeals that he undergoes in his ecstatic descents below and ascents to the sky, suggest the adventures of the figures in popular tales and the heroes of epic literature. Probably a large number of epic "subjects" or motifs, as well as many characters, images, and cliches of epic literature, are, finally, of ecstatic origin, in the sense that they were borrowed from the narrative of shamans describing their journeys and adventures in the superhuman worlds. [ Eliade, Mircea, Shamanism, Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy.]

In short, we suggest that Esoteric Christianity - the REAL teachings of Jesus - were a revival of the most ancient of True Traditions of Freedom - an antediluvian tradition handed down from the Ancient Athenians of Plato's myth - the defenders of the world against the Evil Empire of Atlantis. This Evil Empire of Atlantis is reincarnated in the present day - the controlling empire of our world - and seeks to establish a One World control system exactly as Atlantis did ages ago. Part of the means of doing this includes brainwashing the masses, even those who are seeking alternative explanations in philosophy and religion. For those who seek outside the already corrupted standard religions, there is now the Stargate Conspiracy - the promotion of Egyptian and South American mysticism as the source of the Tradition. And it is a lie.

Christianity is quite interesting when one removes the obvious gloss of the Egyptian resurrection myth. When the reader is fully informed about the variations on these two themes, it is almost pathetically easy to read the New Testament and see what might be original to "Jesus," and what was added by the "creators" of Christianity as we know it.

What is even more interesting was the fact that the only writings contemporary to the times of early Christianity, which mention it specifically, remark that it is a "vile superstition." Yet, what we have as Christianity today, is nothing more or less than the same religious practices of the peoples who branded it a "vile superstition." Obviously something very strange happened between the times of the early Christians, and the times in which Christianity became the established religion. And whatever it was that happened, changed Christianity from a "vile superstition" to an acceptable, all-inclusive, monotheistic device. In short, it seems evident that "true Christianity" has completely disappeared from the world stage and those individuals who call themselves Christian are not, in fact, Christians in the original sense of the word by any stretch of the imagination.

The question that comes to mind is: what would the peoples of that time have considered a "vile superstition," when one is aware of what they considered normal religious practice? The only thing that seemed to fit the bill, so to say, is the possibility that whoever was the figure around which the Jesus legend was wrapped, was teaching that the "God of this world" was an "evil magician." Not only that, but that he probably suggested that man is the manifestation of God, and all creation is the "body of God," and that there was no point in praying to an "external god" at all. Now that would have set just about everybody back then on fire! To suggest that sacrifice to the gods, that appeasing the gods, that honoring the gods, that praying to the gods, that expecting to be saved by or cleansed from sin by any of the gods, was a waste of time would have been absolute heresy to all of the many religions! For them, such an idea, and only such an idea, would have been most definitely a "vile superstition."

In fact, we have something of a parallel in some remarks about Pythagoras. He was accused of believing the "vile superstitions" of the barbarians, that a soul is born over and over again into different bodies as opposed to the nonsense of the Egyptians that induced them to place all their hopes in a physical resurrection, for which purpose they went to such extremes as attempting to preserve their bodies for that future resurrection!

Clement of Alexandria writes:

    These are the times of the oldest wise men and philosophers among the Greeks. And that the most of them were barbarians by extraction, and were trained among barbarians, what need is there to say? Pythagoras is shown to have been either a Tuscan or a Tyrian. And Antisthenes was a Phrygian. And Orpheus was an Odrysian or a Thracian. The most, too, show Homer to have been an Egyptian. Thales was a Phoenician by birth, and was said to have consorted with the prophets of the Egyptians; as also Pythagoras did with the same persons, by whom he was circumcised, that he might enter the adytum and learn from the Egyptians the mystic philosophy. He held converse with the chief of the Chaldeans and the Magi; and he gave a hint of the church, now so called, in the common hall which he maintained. And Plato does not deny that he procured all that is most excellent in philosophy from the barbarians; and he admits that he came into Egypt.

    Whence, writing in the Phaedo that the philosopher can receive aid from all sides, he said: "Great indeed is Greece, O Cebes, in which everywhere there are good men, and many are the races of the barbarians."[…]

    And in the Symposium, Plato, landing the barbarians as practicing philosophy with conspicuous excellence, truly says: "And in many other instances both among Greeks and barbarians, whose temples reared for such sons are already numerous." And it is clear that the barbarians signally honoured their lawgivers and teachers, designating them gods. For, according to Plato, "they think that good souls, on quitting the supercelestial region, submit to come to this Tartarus; and assuming a body, share in all the ills which are involved in birth, from their solicitude for the race of men;" and these make laws and publish philosophy, "than which no greater boon ever came from the gods to the race of men, or will come.[…]

    And it is well known that Plato is found perpetually celebrating the barbarians, remembering that both himself and Pythagoras learned the most and the noblest of their dogmas among the barbarians.[…] [Circa AD 260-340]

But, as one notices when reading Clement, he has an agenda to validate Judaism and the New Covenant of Christianity. He identified "barbarians" as including Egyptians, Persian, Hindus, Babylonians, Phrygians, and so on. Again we find that all we can discover about the deeper beliefs of the ancient secret schools is what we hear from their detractors. In the end, Clement promoted the idea that the "true philosophy" was Hebrew, and that it was preserved most closely in the Egyptian "Mystery Schools." This twisting of the facts by someone with an agenda, has been the foundation for centuries of researchers to look in the wrong direction for the answers, and to follow the wrong clues regarding such things as the Ark of the Covenant and the Holy Grail.

The teaching of Jesus - whatever his real name was - was obviously this True Tradition, and was later corrupted and glossed by those who rewrote the Bible for purposes of power and control.

    But this is nothing new.  Time after time the Esoteric Tradition is misunderstood or deliberately buried, and so it dies.  Then, when the time is ripe, it must either be restored or rephrased.  In the meantime, the meaning is kept alive in communities or schools symbolized by the name "ark," of which Noah's Ark was one.

    A clear sign that the inner knowledge has been misunderstood is the idea that the inner knowledge is "secret."  This misunderstanding comes from a lack of comprehension of the term "inner" itself.  The impression is conveyed that these ideas are the possession of an "inner group" and are not to be given to others, when nothing could be further from the truth.  The real problem is due to what we now understand as "vectors of direction," the many "agents of the Matrix" in our reality who interpret the terminology in a purely material way, and promote their versions on the unsuspecting public.  An example is the case of the crucifixion itself.  The words that Paul used to describe "Christ crucified" have nothing to do with an historical event, and everything to do with an "inner event."  The crucifixion describes things which can and do happen within and between serious esoteric students and is a clear analogy for problems of the inner life of man which urgently require study.  Those who understand the crucifixion in a purely outward way, or who cling to the past as promoted by the Control System, miss the living tradition.

    As Jesus said:  "let the dead bury the dead."

    The fact is: inner knowledge is freely available to all those who are willing to look into themselves and face the pain that this brings.

Boris Mouravieff tells us that the Christian Esoteric Tradition has always remained alive within certain monasteries in Greece, Russia, and elsewhere.  It is true that this knowledge was hermetically hidden, but at the same time, its existence was known and access to it was never forbidden to those seriously interested in esoteric questions.

Mouravieff tells us that his commentaries are drawn directly from the Eastern Christian Tradition: the sacred texts, the commentaries written around these texts, and especially from the Philokalia which is, above all, the same teaching and discipline, transmitted by fully authorized individuals.

Attentive examination and comparison of Mouravieff's work to that of Ouspensky and Gurdjieff will show the incomplete character of the latter, as well as the deviations from the ancient doctrine.

    Christ categorically affirmed that entry into the Kingdom of God is closed to those who have not been born anew.  This second Birth is the object and goal of esoteric work.

Mouravieff tells us:

    The greatest genuine faith, human intelligence, and goodwill, are not sufficient to prevent errors and deviations in everything that touches the domain of Revelation.  The errors and deviations of Ouspensky's book [declared by Gurdjieff to have been accurate as far as it went] - attest to the fact that it was not written under the aegis of the Esoteric Brotherhood.  This means that the facts on which the book was based have a fragmentary character,  In the esoteric realm, all fragmentary knowledge is a source of danger.

As it was in the past, so it is in the present:  certain Gnostic schools, seeing the imperfection of the created world, and without searching for the reason for the existence of these imperfections, have, by a shortcut of thought, jumped to conclusions. One modern day example is the work of Dr. J.S. Chiappalone.

    The Tradition is One, whether it is the esoteric core of Hinduism, Buddhism, Sufism, or Sufism, and whoever delves deeply into these things cannot fail to note the Unity of the teachings.  All the great religions which have issued from the One Tradition are messages of truth - yet each of them addresses only part of humanity - parts with certain character.  Esoteric Christianity , in its perfect expression, aims at a general resurrection while other doctrines, even though they belong to the Truth, essentially aim at individual salvation and are therefore only partial revelations of the Tradition.

    Most of the writings of the Philokalia were intended for people who had already acquired some proficiency in esoteric studies.  One could actually say the same about the Gospels, corrupted and glossed though they be.  Bishop Theophan, in his preface to the Philokalia, insists on the fact that without help nobody can succeed in penetrating the doctrine.  This is why esoteric science conserves and cultivates an oral tradition which brings the letter to life.  Oriental Orthodoxy has known how to keep this Tradition intact by applying the absolute rule of Hermetism in each particular case.  From generation to generation, ever since the time of the Apostles, it has led its disciples up to mystic experience.

    If Hermetism has provided a safeguard for nearly twenty centuries, it must be said that circumstances have now changed.  At the current point in history, as at the time of the Coming of Christ, the veil has been partially raised.  Therefore, for those who want to advance beyond book knowledge, which never goes beyond the domain of information; for those who intensely seek the true sense of life, who want to understand the significance of the mission of those who labor in the vineyards of the Lord at the time of the Harvest, the possibility exists for initiation into this divine Wisdom, mysterious and hidden.

Mouravieff tells us that clarity of the New Testament can be extracted from obscurity by comparison to the Slavonic texts.  There are two reasons for this.  The first is that the translation of the New Testament into Slavonic was done at a time when the spirit of the texts still remained close to the original meaning.  The second is that the fixed nature of the Slavonic languages, Russian in particular, remain very close to the old Slavonic language which is still in used in the divine service of the Orthodox religion in the Slavic countries.

    The Slavonic text is generally attributed to Constantine the Philosopher, also known as St. Cyril, and to his brother St. Methodius, both learned Greeks from Salonika.  Arriving in Chersonese of Tauric, St. Cyril found, in the ninth century, that the Gospels were already written in this language, suggesting that they were produced in a period when the forms remained alive - as stated by the apostle St. Andrew, who taught Christianity in Russia in the first century of the present era… close to the time of the events.

Mouravieff notes that all serious esoteric teaching, as in ordinary education, is almost uniform.

    It is generally accepted that nobody can go on to secondary school without having completed an elementary education.  Nor can a person be admitted to a university without having a secondary education.  These graduations automatically "select" those able to become active members of the cultural elite of human society.

    Exactly the same is true in the esoteric Tradition.

    However, in our modern world, we encounter a curious phenomenon.  For example: we would not seek to discuss Newton's binomial theorem without having studied algebra, for without this, every opinion we expressed on the subject would be worthless.

Yet, in the esoteric field, we find a host of "experts" who declare their opinions on esotericism without having ever learned even the rudiments of this knowledge.

    At the same time, some of them demand "simplicity" from esoteric teachings on the generally accepted principle that Truth itself must be simple.  They conclude from this that access to Truth ought to likewise be simple.  Then they assert that the methods to access Truth must be easily assimilable.

    This argument would be perfectly correct if human beings and the problems they face were simple and just.  However, that is not the case.  There is a long road to travel from our state of distorted inner disorder to any "original simplicity."

    In practice, the doctrine of "simplicity" - if regarded as an axiom - turns the student aside from the strait gate and the narrow way that leads to Life.  Impelled by this counter-truth, he believes he stands before this door, when he is in reality - although undoubtedly in perfectly good faith - walking the wide path that leads to perdition, ad majorem Diaboli gloriam, of course.

    The Doctrine of Simplicity, correct in itself, but wrongly interpreted, becomes a snare for hearts and minds that are already too corrupt; a danger which should be recognized and avoided.

    Some people complain that the subject of the fundamentals of esotericism is not simple.  Others have said that it leads to great clarity.  This apparent contradiction is explained by the fact that esotericism is addressed to readers who are predisposed to esoteric culture by their nature, formation or personal experience.

        Jesus said: "Beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves."  And then he adds:  "You shall know them by their fruits."

    It is difficult, if not impossible, for an esoterically unevolved person to discern false prophets spontaneously.  He will recognize them more easily by their "fruits," by the observable results of their works, which serve as signs.  The Tradition knows and teaches a whole Science of signs.

        Jesus further said:  "Temptations (snares, traps set to entice to sin) are sure to come, but woe to him by or through whom they come!  It would be more profitable for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were hurled into the sea than that he should cause to sin or be a snare…"

    This warning is disturbing, but its value is real.  A thief can carry off our wealth; a 'ravening wolf' can deprive us of salvation. 

    That 'ravening wolves' appear in sheep's clothing we shall learn from the following text, well-phrased to frighten us:

        "It is not everyone that saith unto me:  Lord, Lord, who shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that accomplishes the will of my Father which is in Heaven.  Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name?  And in thy name have cast out devils?  And in thy name done many wonderful works?  And then I shall declare unto them, I never knew you: depart from Me, ye who work iniquity."

    The conclusion is that neither prophecies that are fulfilled nor the occurrence of miracles give us any surety against 'ravening wolves.'

        And in our own times: "There shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they should deceive the very elect."

    Our era is the time of Transition.  We are in the heart of this period, which is relatively short.  All the signs show that the necessary conditions for the End are emerging before our very eyes.

    This time brings with it a great preparatory task for the transition to the approaching Cycle of the Holy Spirit.  The preparatory task fundamental to the Time of Transition can and must be accomplished under the Aegis of the Absolute, for human beings and BY human beings.  Success depends upon the emergence in the near future of a sufficient number of people belonging to a new human type - torch bearers who have an innate predisposition for esoteric work.  And, it is Women who must play the inspirational role in this difficult time of Transition leading to the promised era of redemption.

    The objective of esoteric work is the march towards Consciousness, which means towards Truth.  The final aim that man can hope to achieve by esoteric work is to attain the Second Birth and so overcome Death. 

    With rare exceptions, this aim can only be attained by the student through hared and methodical work.  The sum of the conscious efforts required is proportional to the degeneracy of the Personality.

    The discipline is accepted voluntarily, but it is of iron.  The student can abandon the work at any moment to return to worldly interests.

    The freedom of choice and the initiative demanded of the seeker bring a danger: that of taking the false for the true; the impure for the pure, allowing himself to become subject to traps and snares.  When such errors are made by the pure in heart, they will be warned in time, even if they persist in their error. 

    The real danger, which can lead to mortal sin, to a definite check, occurs when an impure heart seeks to be served by higher psychic forces for its own egoistic ends.  This is a quagmire.

    A curious phenomenon often occurs in the human mind when it considers the generally hermetized theories and facts of the esoteric realm.

    In any field of science, pure, moral, applied, it is generally accepted that we must be well versed in a subject before we can give a valid opinion.  To speak seriously, one must speak of what one knows, which presupposes previous studies.

    In the esoteric domain, many purveyors of "esoteric science" believe themselves to be competent without even completing an elementary education.  They may receive all kinds of "insights" and messages from all kinds of sources, but the problem with that is that they judge these messages and teachings to be positive or true before they have even developed within themselves the correct instrument with which to judge.

    The problem is:  we KNOW that any given thing can only be conceived, understood and judged by something similar or higher.  Without this, all judgments, discussions and advice about esoteric facts remain comparable to evaluations and opinions about the shade of a specific color by someone born blind.

    Just as the world we live in is closed off, invisible to the fetus in its mother's womb until the awakening of its birth, even so the higher planes of Life, the astral and spiritual, are similarly closed and invisible to us until the Second Birth.  Until then, man can only form hypotheses or refer to the testimony of authors who have themselves been Twice born.

    As for passing valid judgments of these facts, no one can do this until he has himself crossed the second Threshold. 

    What seems clear is that it is commonplace these days for people of perfectly good faith to persist in their ignorant attitudes about esotericism.  This phenomenon is due to two principle causes.  One is the general tendency of humans to claim qualities which exist in them only in potential, and the second - a consequence of the first - is the deification of Personality.  Without doing any real, prolonged work, they "trust themselves" or rely on their own "truth" to guide them. 

    We are not speaking here of people of bad faith; we are speaking of sincere people who stray into gross error.  Their case is precisely that of the sick in need of a physician.  They are small "Sauls" who could be converted to small "Pauls," and thus might become useful laborers and earn a reward in the fields of the Lord.  But they wander in their searching beyond the place where they could receive compensation for the work that they have done.

    In esoteric work the phenomenalist mentality seeks facts.  It looks for manifestations that confirm that its work is well founded, or which simply satisfy its curiosity.  This is where the snares and traps and greatest dangers lie.  For it is often possible to obtain the desired "facts" quite easily from the astral realms, to which the human personality also belongs.  When the personality is firmly anchored in the physical body it is generally incapable of making direct connection with the astral levels.  However, certain persons, known as sensitives, have the innate or acquired faculty of momentarily weakening the ties of the personality to the physical body so that, with no esoteric evolution whatever, they are able to connect with this level - connecting to the coarsest levels of the astral.

    "Facts" obtained this way are often regarded by people who seek them as coming from the spiritual level.  However, this level is a vast reservoir of psychic entities that have no contact with the higher plane, including amongst them discarnate Personalities, who normally remain there to await their Second Death - the negative equivalent of the Second Birth.  This usually occurs on the fortieth day after death of the physical body.

    The Tradition expressly warns seekers against contacts with this realm which is so dangerous and full of the worst illusions. 

    The power of intervention of these entities in the lives of humans is a function of the credulity they meet.  The yearning to experience miracles, visions, etc, creates an atmosphere favorable for their appearance, which can assume various forms, often perceptible to the physical senses.

    In the materialist mind of the cultured man of our era, the true and the false in esoteric research easily become mixed together.  This entanglement shows above all in the domain of our affections, which are generally unbalanced in us because the habit of lying has become our true second nature.  The innate faculty of immediate discernment of the true from the false is thus lost, and man, even the most cultured and learned, becomes singularly credulous, particularly in the mystical realm.

    This imbalance affects us according to law:  credulity is inversely proportional to true faith. 

And here we must define faith: 

    Faith is an openness and trusting attitude to truth and reality, whatever it may turn out to be.  This is a risky and adventurous state of mind.  Belief, in the religious sense, is the opposite of faith – because it is a fervent wishing or hope, a compulsive clinging to the idea that the universe is arranged and governed in such and such a way.  Belief is holding to a rock; faith is learning how to swim – and this whole universe swims in boundless space.[1]

In other words, the less open we are to truth and reality, the more our credulity grows and the more we are inclined to adopt "beliefs" and rituals, often taking grotesque forms. In this mechanism we can see the familiar action of the General Law of Accident which is the essence of the Matrix: 

    To inspire the man who seeks the Way with the idea that he is already on the way.  This is the best and the most common means used by the "Devil" to turn away the seeker who has had insufficient warning from the narrow way which leads to Life.  Jesus asked:

        How can ye believe which receive glory from one another, and seek not the glory that comes from God only?

    When we accept the "glory of men," yet still believe that we are on or walking on the Way, we fall directly under the law of equilibrium.  Jesus alluded to this when he quoted the Pharisees who prayed in the streets, saying that "they have already received their reward."

    It is well understood that the human Personality, in the unfinished state in which we find it, forms our only instrument for esoteric work.  Better still, it is a gift; it is the talent the Master has given us so that we may make it bear fruit.  Woe to the servant who buries it in the earth of his body.  "Cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth."  And here, this is no metaphor. 

    We must therefore work with love and with all our strength since we do not know at what hour the Master will come.

     This being so, the attitude of the esoteric Doctrine towards lying is clear  and realistic.  ...We must fight energetically against .. useless lies.

    It is only by training of this nature that we shall progressively be able to  master the rooted tendency to lie which exists within us.  Every attempt to  hurry things, so far as lying to others is concerned, though it be a noble  attempt, is doomed to early failure.  We live in a world which is immersed in  lies and moved by lies.

    It is also necessary to guard against a variant of the habit of lying to  ourselves, one which we commonly adopt from early childhood, and against which  we must fight by every means.  This variant is widespread because at first  glance it appears to us to be a positive attitude.  ...When applied to  ourselves and for our own benefit, with the aim of softening a shock, or  regaining our inner peace after we have sinned, or excusing our actions or  faults, this idiom crystallizes within us over a period of time an auto- tranquilizing mechanism.  ...It is a true mechanism of mental anesthesia,  founded on a refined and disguised lie.  It sows hypocrisy in man towards  himself.

    This auto-tranquillizer must be destroyed."

But we see so often how desperately people want to be "tranquilize."  How  many individuals have written to us asking for an answer that would help  them feel peaceful and enable them to go to sleep at night.  They want  "positive messages."  They want a program of meditation that will make them  feel good, or something to do or "look forward to" that will ease their anxiety  when they glimpse, momentarily, the reality of the Matrix.  They want to feel  chosen and special by virtue of having been "contacted" and performing rituals without doing the absolutely agonizing work necessary to precipitate transformation.

Mouravieff continues:

    The permanent link which must be introduced between the Personality and the  real "I" is esoteric Knowledge.  The knowledge and understanding that it  permits us to acquire represent the philosopher's stone of the medieval  mystics.  They are capable of provoking in man the transmutation to which he  aspires.

    We must work ceaselessly, for fear of not succeeding in time.  One must work,  says Jesus,  "while it is day: the night comes when no man can work."

These commentaries of Mouravieff are absolutely invaluable, and would be helpful to every seeker on the path and reader of the Cassiopaean Material.  This is especially so because Mouravieff actually describes  things that  we have already experienced, even though we did not precisely  understand what it was we were doing, how or even why.

For example,  Mouravieff calls the influences of the material world, the Matrix, the  predator's mind, etc, the "A influences."  (He has diagrams showing how they  affect the consciousness.)  The influences of the esoteric center, the "real  world" concealed by the "matrix illusion," the "truth," are called "B  influences." 

He writes:

    If a man spends his life without distinguishing between "A" and "B"  influences, he will end as he started, one could say mechanically, driven by  the Law of Accident.  ...He can have a brilliant career in the meaning the  world gives to this expression.  Yet he will come to the end of his days  without having either learned or understood anything of the Reality.  And dust  returns to dust.

    In life, every being is subjected to a sort of competitive test.  If he  discerns the existence of the "B" influences; if he acquires a taste for  gathering and absorbing them; if he continually aspires to assimilate them  better; his mixed inner nature will slowly undergo a certain kind of evolution.

    And if the efforts which he makes to absorb the "B" influences are constant  and sufficient in force, a magnetic centre can be formed within him. 

    If this center once born in him is carefully developed, it takes form, and in  its turn will exercise an influence over the results of the "A" influences  which are always active, deflecting them.

    Such deflection may be violent.  In general it transgresses the laws of  exterior life and provokes many conflicts in and around man.  If he loses the  battle, he emerges with the conviction the the "B" influences are nothing but  illusion: that the only reality is represented by the "A" influences.  Slowly,  the magnetic center which had been formed within him is reabsorbed and  vanishes.  Then, from the esoteric point of view, his situation is worse than  the one he had started with, when he was just beginning to discern "B"  influences.

    But, if he emerges a winner in this FIRST struggle, his magnetic centre,  consolidated and reinforced, will draw him to a man having a "C" influence  stronger than his own, and possessing a stronger magnetic center.  And so on in  succession, the last man being in connection with another having in influence  "D", who will be his link with the Esoteric Center "E."

    Henceforth in life, that man will no longer be isolated. 

    To the measure of its growth, the man will escape the dominion of the law of  accident and enter the domain of consciousness.

Mouravieff then shows a diagram of the person who deludes himself and does not  struggle against the lies of the Matrix... who has not engaged in the work of  stripping away lies:

    This second figure, with black magnetic centers, represents the situation  where man deludes himself and, believing he is absorbing "B" influences and  making the necessary selection all the while, he in fact absorbs "A"  influences... This will put him into contact with people who possess magnetic  centers of the same nature: who are themselves duped or who dupe others, and  who have no direct or indirect link with the esoteric Center.

In both the Wave Series and the Adventure Series, we have been dealing with identifying these very influences and emphasizing the necessity of "collecting" the "A" influences in terms of "seeing the unseen" of what we have called the Theological Reality. We have also met many characters that are aptly described by Mouravieff in his diagram of those individuals who have deluded themselves and have created a magnetic center of negativity, and how they attract to themselves others with similar negative magnetic centers.

In other words, the activities described in the Adventures series - the constant questioning,  stripping, looking at what is difficult and dealing with it - the shocks of  seeing the Matrix, the "man behind the curtain," the effort to "see the unseen"  is the very activity of collecting these "B" influences which then lead to the  "magnetic center," or "lodestar," as the C's called it.

    Q: When I post material on the website, those people who resonate to the material believe that this refers to them also. I have been of the opinion that Unified Thought Form being must mean a very large group as represented in this density. I know that we are dealing with limiting terms. But, is this applied to people who CHOOSE the Cassiopaean option?
    A: Maybe it is best to say it applies to those who recognize the application.
    Q: So, if they recognize it, if they know it is them, they are part of it. (A) But, thinking in nonlinear terms, its up to us to work to make this precise. You are asking this question which implies that the answer exists. But, exactly what the answer is may be it is not yet chosen, and it is up to us to make it this way.
    A: Lodestar is a clue for you.

Mouravieff writes:

    This evolution seems a long process, an uninterrupted combat with a series of  successes and falls.  More than once, he who searches will fall into crises of  discouragement; more than once it will seem to him that he is being driven  beyond the limits of his own life; he will sometimes feel crushed under the  burden of the tests and difficulties against which he will be pitted during his  search. 

    This can be understood when we know that esoteric science in its teaching goes  far beyond simple information.  Its purpose, in fact, is nothing less than the  TRANSFORMATION of the very being of those who study it...

    In every case where esoteric science offers ALL, it demands ALL in return.  One  must pay all.

    It is impossible to reach the true by the path of lies or hypocritical games,  because in this case we seek to BE, rather than to "appear to be."

Mouravieff describes the reaction of the "matrix/ B influences" to the person  who is on the Path:

    As long as man accepts the principle of the final annihilation of his  Personality without a fight, he can carry on in life without attracting the  increasing pressure of the General Law of Accident upon himself.

    The case is totally different if he struggles to surpass the limits which it  imposes.  He then runs against the action upon him of this Law and its  derivatives.  It acts simultaneously on several planes: physical, mental and  moral.  Its action on the moral plane is conceived by man, since time  immemorial, in the form of the personification: the Devil."

We are also reminded of Gurdjieff's remarks about the "mechanical force"  having promoters and adherents at very high levels who act under its powerful  influences.  We suggest that both are 4 and 5 D STS beings.

    ...Once the first positive results are obtained those students will  unmistakable run up against the active opposition of the law and the "game of  the Crafty One."

    It must be realized that in placing himself under the aegis of the Law of  Exception, man goes against the General Law of Accident, which he is even   called upon to overthrow, if only on the individual scale.  He must no forget -  under penalty of "surprise attack" - that salvation depends on victory over the  Devil, which, as we have said, is the personalized moral aspect of the General  Law of Accident.  This is so even though this, being a cosmic law, is naturally  a divine law. 

    One must not be afraid, as the Law of Exception is also a divine law.

    In choosing it, man continues to serve the interest of the whole, but  differently and in an incomparably more efficient manner.

    During his fight against the first law, he is subject to tests that often take  the form of temptations.  ...We are permitted to draw attention to the indirect  nature of diabolical action.

    If, aiming straight towards his goal, which is liberation and salvation, the  seeker successfully overcomes the obstacles and by this shows proof of a  strength that would permit him to defy the authority of the General Law, the  latter will begin to act upon him indirectly, generally by the mediation of his  near ones if they do not follow the same path:  this action occurs on the moral  plane, and often takes emotional forms appealing to his most noble, generous  and disinterested sentiments: to his charity; his obligation; his pity.  It  impels him down blind alleys, insinuating that he will thus be returning to his  duty, that by so doing he will go on walking in the right path, etc. 

    This will clarify the profound saying of Jesus that : "A man's worst enemies  are those of his own household."

    Let us repeat:  esoteric work is by its nature a revolutionary work.  The  seeker seeks a change of state: to overcome Death and attain Salvation.  This  is the goal give to this work by the scriptures:  "If ye live after the flesh,  ye must die."

    The man who lives passively under the first law, insensibly and without being  aware of it  - even as an excellent citizen - involves himself in "The broad  way that leadeth to destruction; he who chooses the Law of Exception takes :  "The narrow road that leadeth to life."

Commentary on Boris Mouravieff's Gnosis

The cult of Demeter which celebrated the Eleusinian rites was well established in Mycenaea in the 13th century BC, and it is more than likely that the Feast of Tabernacles in Canaan was an offshoot of this activity. Our sources of information regarding the Eleusinian Mysteries include the ruins of the sanctuary there; numerous statues, bas reliefs, and pottery. We also have reports from ancient writers such as Aeschylos, Sophocles, Herodotus, Aristophanes, Plutarch, and Pausanias - all of whom were initiates - as well as the accounts of Christian commentators like Clement of Alexandria, Hippolytus, Tertullian, and Astorias, who were critics and not initiates. Yet for all this evidence, the true nature of the Mysteries remains shrouded in uncertainty because the participants were remarkably steadfast in honoring their pledge not to reveal what took place in the Telesterion, or inner sanctum of the Temple of Demeter. To violate that oath of secrecy was a capital offense. For these reasons,scholars today must make use of circumstantial evidence and inferences, with the result that there is still no consensus as to what did or did not take place.

Many experts have concluded - probably erroneously - that the Mysteries at Eleusis originally must have come from Egypt. The fact is, the sanctuary ruins in Eleusis evidently go back centuries earlier than the Egyptian Hymn to Demeter recited by Homer that is often cited as the proof that the origin was Egyptian. What is more, the excavations have unearthed no Egyptian artifacts there from that period.

Many scholars today favor the view that the cult of Demeter probably derived from Thessaly or Thrace. They base this conclusion partly on references in Homer and other ancient authors to some evidently pre-Dorian temples to Demeter in the Thessalian towns of Thermopylae, Pyrasos, and Pherai; partly on certain etymological links connecting key words in the rites of Demeter to pre-Hellenic dialects from the north . Other scholars point out that Demeter may be the same as a goddess "Dameter," who is mentioned briefly in Linear B tablets from Pylos dating from approximately 1200 BC. This evidence suggests that the cult of Demeter may after all have originated in the southern Peleponnesus.

In any case, whether the specific cult of Demeter at Eleusis originated in northern or southern Greece, the undeniable parallels with worship of grain goddesses in other parts of the eastern Mediterranean region point to frequent contacts and the cross-fertilization of religious ideas. And we certainly think that the Canaanite Feast of Tabernacles was a corrupted version of some more ancient form.

As it happens, the term "Thesmophoria" is derived from thesmoi, meaning "laws," and phoria, "carrying," in reference to the goddess as "law-bearer." But the symbolism of the ark as the "law bearer" in the "tent of meeting," or the "Mother-Delta," the "doorway to the higher realms," replaced the original meaning and the role of women in the process. Based on our own researches, we believe that True Christianity - which is almost virtually unknown today - was a resurgence of a very ancient Tradition - and that this same Tradition was preserved, in part, in Shamanic lore, was part of the Cathar beliefs as well as the true meaning of the Grail legends.

Jessie L. Weston writes in From Ritual to Romance:

    The more closely one studies pre-Christian Theology, the more strongly one is impressed with the deeply and daringly spiritual character of its speculations, and the more doubtful it appears that such teaching can depend upon the unaided processes of human thought, or can have been evolved from such germs as we find among the supposedly 'primitive' peoples... Are they really primitive? Or are we dealing, not with the primary elements of religion, but with the disjecta membra of a vanished civilization?

    Certain it is that so far as historical evidence goes our earliest records point to the recognition of a spiritual, not of a material, origin of the human race. Students of the Grail literature cannot fail to have been impressed by a certain atmosphere of awe and mystery which surrounds that enigmatic Vessel. There is a secret connected with it, the revelation of which will entail dire misfortune on the betrayer. [...] It is so secret a thing that no woman, be she wife or maid, may venture to speak of it. [...]

    There is no doubt that the Grail was something secret, mysterious and awful, the exact knowledge of which was reserved to a select few. […] The Nature Cults still remain reliable guides; it is their inner, their esoteric, ritual which will enable us to bridge the gulf between what appears at first sight the wholly irreconcilable elements of Folk-tale and high Spiritual mystery."

In our work on Noah, we have tracked the Grail legends back to prehistoric times - in Western Europe and Central Asia - via the very area emphasized in many other ancient myths, including that of Jason and the Argonauts: Colchis and the Caucasus regions. Mircea Eliade writes:

    Recent researches have clearly brought out the "shamanic" elements in the religion of the paleolithic hunters. Horst Kierchner has interpreted the celebrated relief at Lascaux as a representation of a shamanic trance. The same author considers that the "kommandostabe" - mysterious objects found in prehistoric sites - are drumsticks. If this interpretation is accepted, the prehistoric sorcerers would already have used drums comparable to those of the Siberian shamans.

    Finally, Karl J. Narr has reconsidered the problem of the "origin" and chronology of shamanism in his important study. He brings out the influence of notions of fertility (Venus statuettes) on the religious beliefs of the prehistoric North Asian hunters; but this influence did not disrupt the paleolithic tradition. His conclusions are as follows: Animal skulls and bones found in the sites of the European Paleolithic (before 50,000 - ca. 30,000 BC) can be interpreted as ritual offerings. [...] Soon afterward, probably about 25,000 BC, Europe offers evidence for the earliest forms of shamanism (Lascaux) with the plastic representations of the bird, the tutelary spirit, and ecstasy. [...]

    What appears to be certain is the antiquity of "shamanic" rituals and symbols. It remains to be determined whether these documents brought to light by prehistoric discoveries represent the first expressions of a shamanism in statu nascendi or are merely the earliest documents today available for an earlier religious complex, which, however, did not find "plastic" manifestations (drawings, ritual objects, etc) before the period of Lascaux.[…]

    Everywhere in those lands, [ in Central and North Asia,] and from the earliest times, we find documents for the existence of a Supreme Being of celestial structure, who also corresponds morphologically to all the other Supreme Beings of the archaic religions. The symbolism of ascent, with all the rites and myths dependent on it, must be connected with celestial Supreme Beings; we know that "height" was sacred as such, that many supreme gods of archaic peoples are called "He on high," or "he of the Sky," or simply "Sky." This symbolism of ascent and "height" retains its value even after the "withdrawal" of the celestial Supreme Being - for, as is well known, Supreme Beings gradually lose their active place in the cult, giving way to religious forms that are more "dynamic" and "familiar" (the gods of storm and fertility, demiurges, the souls of the dead, the Great Goddesses, etc.) […]

    The reduction or even the total loss in religious currency of uranian Supreme Beings is sometimes indicated in myths concerning a primordial and paradisal time when communications between heaven and earth were easy and accessible to everyone; as the result of some happening, these communications were broken off and the Supreme Beings withdrew to the highest sky.[…]

    The disappearance of the cult of the celestial Supreme Being did not nullify the symbolism of ascent with all its implication. […] The shamanic ecstasy could be considered a reactualization of the mythical illud tempus when men could communicate in concreto with the sky. It is indubitable that the celestial ascent of the shaman is a survival, profoundly modified and sometimes degenerate, of this archaic religious ideology centered on faith in a celestial Supreme Being and belief in concrete communications between heaven and earth. […] The myths refer to more intimate relations between the Supreme Beings and shamans; in particular, they tell of a First Shaman, sent to earth by the Supreme Being or his surrogate to defend human beings against diseases and evil spirits.

    This historical change in the religions of Central and North Asia […] in turn altered the meaning of the shaman's ecstatic experience. Descents to the underworld, the struggle against evil spirits, the increasingly familiar relations with "spirits" that result in their "embodiment" or in the shaman's being "possessed" by "spirits," are innovations, most of them recent. In addition, there are the influences from the south, which appeared quite early and which altered both cosmology and the mythology and techniques of ecstasy. Among these southern influences we must reckon, in later times, the contribution of Buddhism and Lamaism, added to the Iranian and, in the last analysis, Mesopotamian influences that preceded them.

    The initiatory schema of the shaman's ritual death and resurrection is likewise an innovation, but one that goes back to much earlier times; in any case, it cannot be ascribed to influences from the ancient Near East. But the innovations introduced by the ancestor cult particularly affected the structure of this initatory schema. The very concept of mystical death was altered by the many and various religious changes effected by lunar mythologies, the cult of the dead, and the elaboration of magical ideologies.[including Egyptian]

    Hence we must conceive of Asiatic shamanism as an archaic technique of ecstasy whose original underlying ideology - belief in a celestial Supreme Being with whom it was possible to have direct relations by ascending into the sky - was constantly being transformed by a ongoing series of exotic contributions culminating in the invasion of Buddhism.

    The concept of mystical death, furthermore, encouraged increasingly regular relations with the ancestral souls and the "spirits," relations that ended in "possession." The phenomenology of the trance underwent many changes and corruptions, due in large part to confusion as to the precise nature of ecstasy. Yet all these innovations and corruptions did not succeed in eliminating the possibility of the true shamanic ecstasy.

    More than once we have discerned in the shamanic experience a "nostalgia for paradise" that suggests one of the oldest types of Christian mystical experience. As for the "inner light," which plays a part of the first importance in Indian mysticism and metaphysics as well as in Christian mystical theology, it is already documented in shamanism.

    But shamanism is important not only for the place that it holds in the history of mysticism. The shamans have played an essential role in the defense of the psychic integrity of the community They are preeminently the antidemonic champions; they combat not only demons and disease, but also the black magicians. [A shaman is a] tireless slayer of demons. The military elements that are of great importance in certain types of Asian shamanism (lance, cuirass, bow, sword, etc.) are accounted for by the requirements of war against the demons, the true enemies of humanity. In a way it can be said that shamanism defends life, health, fertility, the world of "light," against death, diseases, sterility, disaster, and the world of "darkness."[...]

    What is fundamental and universal is the shaman's struggle against what we could call "the powers of evil." […] The shaman's essential role in the defense of the psychic integrity of the community depends above all on this: men are sure that one of them is able to help them in the critical circumstances produced by the inhabitants of the invisible world. […] A member of the community is able to see what is hidden and invisible to the rest and to bring back direct and reliable information from the supernatural worlds.[…]

    We have already referred to the likenesses between the accounts of shamanic ecstasies and certain epic themes in oral literature. The shaman's adventures in the other world, the ordeals that he undergoes in his ecstatic descents below and ascents to the sky, suggest the adventures of the figures in popular tales and the heroes of epic literature. Probably a large number of epic "subjects" or motifs, as well as many characters, images, and cliches of epic literature, are, finally, of ecstatic origin, in the sense that they were borrowed from the narrative of shamans describing their journeys and adventures in the superhuman worlds. [ Eliade, Mircea, Shamanism, Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy.]

In short, we suggest that Esoteric Christianity - the REAL teachings of Jesus - were a revival of the most ancient of True Traditions of Freedom - an antediluvian tradition handed down from the Ancient Athenians of Plato's myth - the defenders of the world against the Evil Empire of Atlantis. This Evil Empire of Atlantis is reincarnated in the present day - the controlling empire of our world - and seeks to establish a One World control system exactly as Atlantis did ages ago. Part of the means of doing this includes brainwashing the masses, even those who are seeking alternative explanations in philosophy and religion. For those who seek outside the already corrupted standard religions, there is now the Stargate Conspiracy - the promotion of Egyptian and South American mysticism as the source of the Tradition. And it is a lie.

Christianity is quite interesting when one removes the obvious gloss of the Egyptian resurrection myth. When the reader is fully informed about the variations on these two themes, it is almost pathetically easy to read the New Testament and see what might be original to "Jesus," and what was added by the "creators" of Christianity as we know it.

What is even more interesting was the fact that the only writings contemporary to the times of early Christianity, which mention it specifically, remark that it is a "vile superstition." Yet, what we have as Christianity today, is nothing more or less than the same religious practices of the peoples who branded it a "vile superstition." Obviously something very strange happened between the times of the early Christians, and the times in which Christianity became the established religion. And whatever it was that happened, changed Christianity from a "vile superstition" to an acceptable, all-inclusive, monotheistic device. In short, it seems evident that "true Christianity" has completely disappeared from the world stage and those individuals who call themselves Christian are not, in fact, Christians in the original sense of the word by any stretch of the imagination.

The question that comes to mind is: what would the peoples of that time have considered a "vile superstition," when one is aware of what they considered normal religious practice? The only thing that seemed to fit the bill, so to say, is the possibility that whoever was the figure around which the Jesus legend was wrapped, was teaching that the "God of this world" was an "evil magician." Not only that, but that he probably suggested that man is the manifestation of God, and all creation is the "body of God," and that there was no point in praying to an "external god" at all. Now that would have set just about everybody back then on fire! To suggest that sacrifice to the gods, that appeasing the gods, that honoring the gods, that praying to the gods, that expecting to be saved by or cleansed from sin by any of the gods, was a waste of time would have been absolute heresy to all of the many religions! For them, such an idea, and only such an idea, would have been most definitely a "vile superstition."

In fact, we have something of a parallel in some remarks about Pythagoras. He was accused of believing the "vile superstitions" of the barbarians, that a soul is born over and over again into different bodies as opposed to the nonsense of the Egyptians that induced them to place all their hopes in a physical resurrection, for which purpose they went to such extremes as attempting to preserve their bodies for that future resurrection!

Clement of Alexandria writes:

    These are the times of the oldest wise men and philosophers among the Greeks. And that the most of them were barbarians by extraction, and were trained among barbarians, what need is there to say? Pythagoras is shown to have been either a Tuscan or a Tyrian. And Antisthenes was a Phrygian. And Orpheus was an Odrysian or a Thracian. The most, too, show Homer to have been an Egyptian. Thales was a Phoenician by birth, and was said to have consorted with the prophets of the Egyptians; as also Pythagoras did with the same persons, by whom he was circumcised, that he might enter the adytum and learn from the Egyptians the mystic philosophy. He held converse with the chief of the Chaldeans and the Magi; and he gave a hint of the church, now so called, in the common hall which he maintained. And Plato does not deny that he procured all that is most excellent in philosophy from the barbarians; and he admits that he came into Egypt.

    Whence, writing in the Phaedo that the philosopher can receive aid from all sides, he said: "Great indeed is Greece, O Cebes, in which everywhere there are good men, and many are the races of the barbarians."[…]

    And in the Symposium, Plato, landing the barbarians as practicing philosophy with conspicuous excellence, truly says: "And in many other instances both among Greeks and barbarians, whose temples reared for such sons are already numerous." And it is clear that the barbarians signally honoured their lawgivers and teachers, designating them gods. For, according to Plato, "they think that good souls, on quitting the supercelestial region, submit to come to this Tartarus; and assuming a body, share in all the ills which are involved in birth, from their solicitude for the race of men;" and these make laws and publish philosophy, "than which no greater boon ever came from the gods to the race of men, or will come.[…]

    And it is well known that Plato is found perpetually celebrating the barbarians, remembering that both himself and Pythagoras learned the most and the noblest of their dogmas among the barbarians.[…] [Circa AD 260-340]

But, as one notices when reading Clement, he has an agenda to validate Judaism and the New Covenant of Christianity. He identified "barbarians" as including Egyptians, Persian, Hindus, Babylonians, Phrygians, and so on. Again we find that all we can discover about the deeper beliefs of the ancient secret schools is what we hear from their detractors. In the end, Clement promoted the idea that the "true philosophy" was Hebrew, and that it was preserved most closely in the Egyptian "Mystery Schools." This twisting of the facts by someone with an agenda, has been the foundation for centuries of researchers to look in the wrong direction for the answers, and to follow the wrong clues regarding such things as the Ark of the Covenant and the Holy Grail.

The teaching of Jesus - whatever his real name was - was obviously this True Tradition, and was later corrupted and glossed by those who rewrote the Bible for purposes of power and control.

    But this is nothing new.  Time after time the Esoteric Tradition is misunderstood or deliberately buried, and so it dies.  Then, when the time is ripe, it must either be restored or rephrased.  In the meantime, the meaning is kept alive in communities or schools symbolized by the name "ark," of which Noah's Ark was one.

    A clear sign that the inner knowledge has been misunderstood is the idea that the inner knowledge is "secret."  This misunderstanding comes from a lack of comprehension of the term "inner" itself.  The impression is conveyed that these ideas are the possession of an "inner group" and are not to be given to others, when nothing could be further from the truth.  The real problem is due to what we now understand as "vectors of direction," the many "agents of the Matrix" in our reality who interpret the terminology in a purely material way, and promote their versions on the unsuspecting public.  An example is the case of the crucifixion itself.  The words that Paul used to describe "Christ crucified" have nothing to do with an historical event, and everything to do with an "inner event."  The crucifixion describes things which can and do happen within and between serious esoteric students and is a clear analogy for problems of the inner life of man which urgently require study.  Those who understand the crucifixion in a purely outward way, or who cling to the past as promoted by the Control System, miss the living tradition.

    As Jesus said:  "let the dead bury the dead."

    The fact is: inner knowledge is freely available to all those who are willing to look into themselves and face the pain that this brings.

Boris Mouravieff tells us that the Christian Esoteric Tradition has always remained alive within certain monasteries in Greece, Russia, and elsewhere.  It is true that this knowledge was hermetically hidden, but at the same time, its existence was known and access to it was never forbidden to those seriously interested in esoteric questions.

Mouravieff tells us that his commentaries are drawn directly from the Eastern Christian Tradition: the sacred texts, the commentaries written around these texts, and especially from the Philokalia which is, above all, the same teaching and discipline, transmitted by fully authorized individuals.

Attentive examination and comparison of Mouravieff's work to that of Ouspensky and Gurdjieff will show the incomplete character of the latter, as well as the deviations from the ancient doctrine.

    Christ categorically affirmed that entry into the Kingdom of God is closed to those who have not been born anew.  This second Birth is the object and goal of esoteric work.

Mouravieff tells us:

    The greatest genuine faith, human intelligence, and goodwill, are not sufficient to prevent errors and deviations in everything that touches the domain of Revelation.  The errors and deviations of Ouspensky's book [declared by Gurdjieff to have been accurate as far as it went] - attest to the fact that it was not written under the aegis of the Esoteric Brotherhood.  This means that the facts on which the book was based have a fragmentary character,  In the esoteric realm, all fragmentary knowledge is a source of danger.

As it was in the past, so it is in the present:  certain Gnostic schools, seeing the imperfection of the created world, and without searching for the reason for the existence of these imperfections, have, by a shortcut of thought, jumped to conclusions. One modern day example is the work of Dr. J.S. Chiappalone.

    The Tradition is One, whether it is the esoteric core of Hinduism, Buddhism, Sufism, or Sufism, and whoever delves deeply into these things cannot fail to note the Unity of the teachings.  All the great religions which have issued from the One Tradition are messages of truth - yet each of them addresses only part of humanity - parts with certain character.  Esoteric Christianity , in its perfect expression, aims at a general resurrection while other doctrines, even though they belong to the Truth, essentially aim at individual salvation and are therefore only partial revelations of the Tradition.

    Most of the writings of the Philokalia were intended for people who had already acquired some proficiency in esoteric studies.  One could actually say the same about the Gospels, corrupted and glossed though they be.  Bishop Theophan, in his preface to the Philokalia, insists on the fact that without help nobody can succeed in penetrating the doctrine.  This is why esoteric science conserves and cultivates an oral tradition which brings the letter to life.  Oriental Orthodoxy has known how to keep this Tradition intact by applying the absolute rule of Hermetism in each particular case.  From generation to generation, ever since the time of the Apostles, it has led its disciples up to mystic experience.

    If Hermetism has provided a safeguard for nearly twenty centuries, it must be said that circumstances have now changed.  At the current point in history, as at the time of the Coming of Christ, the veil has been partially raised.  Therefore, for those who want to advance beyond book knowledge, which never goes beyond the domain of information; for those who intensely seek the true sense of life, who want to understand the significance of the mission of those who labor in the vineyards of the Lord at the time of the Harvest, the possibility exists for initiation into this divine Wisdom, mysterious and hidden.

Mouravieff tells us that clarity of the New Testament can be extracted from obscurity by comparison to the Slavonic texts.  There are two reasons for this.  The first is that the translation of the New Testament into Slavonic was done at a time when the spirit of the texts still remained close to the original meaning.  The second is that the fixed nature of the Slavonic languages, Russian in particular, remain very close to the old Slavonic language which is still in used in the divine service of the Orthodox religion in the Slavic countries.

    The Slavonic text is generally attributed to Constantine the Philosopher, also known as St. Cyril, and to his brother St. Methodius, both learned Greeks from Salonika.  Arriving in Chersonese of Tauric, St. Cyril found, in the ninth century, that the Gospels were already written in this language, suggesting that they were produced in a period when the forms remained alive - as stated by the apostle St. Andrew, who taught Christianity in Russia in the first century of the present era… close to the time of the events.

Mouravieff notes that all serious esoteric teaching, as in ordinary education, is almost uniform.

    It is generally accepted that nobody can go on to secondary school without having completed an elementary education.  Nor can a person be admitted to a university without having a secondary education.  These graduations automatically "select" those able to become active members of the cultural elite of human society.

    Exactly the same is true in the esoteric Tradition.

    However, in our modern world, we encounter a curious phenomenon.  For example: we would not seek to discuss Newton's binomial theorem without having studied algebra, for without this, every opinion we expressed on the subject would be worthless.

Yet, in the esoteric field, we find a host of "experts" who declare their opinions on esotericism without having ever learned even the rudiments of this knowledge.

    At the same time, some of them demand "simplicity" from esoteric teachings on the generally accepted principle that Truth itself must be simple.  They conclude from this that access to Truth ought to likewise be simple.  Then they assert that the methods to access Truth must be easily assimilable.

    This argument would be perfectly correct if human beings and the problems they face were simple and just.  However, that is not the case.  There is a long road to travel from our state of distorted inner disorder to any "original simplicity."

    In practice, the doctrine of "simplicity" - if regarded as an axiom - turns the student aside from the strait gate and the narrow way that leads to Life.  Impelled by this counter-truth, he believes he stands before this door, when he is in reality - although undoubtedly in perfectly good faith - walking the wide path that leads to perdition, ad majorem Diaboli gloriam, of course.

    The Doctrine of Simplicity, correct in itself, but wrongly interpreted, becomes a snare for hearts and minds that are already too corrupt; a danger which should be recognized and avoided.

    Some people complain that the subject of the fundamentals of esotericism is not simple.  Others have said that it leads to great clarity.  This apparent contradiction is explained by the fact that esotericism is addressed to readers who are predisposed to esoteric culture by their nature, formation or personal experience.

        Jesus said: "Beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves."  And then he adds:  "You shall know them by their fruits."

    It is difficult, if not impossible, for an esoterically unevolved person to discern false prophets spontaneously.  He will recognize them more easily by their "fruits," by the observable results of their works, which serve as signs.  The Tradition knows and teaches a whole Science of signs.

        Jesus further said:  "Temptations (snares, traps set to entice to sin) are sure to come, but woe to him by or through whom they come!  It would be more profitable for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were hurled into the sea than that he should cause to sin or be a snare…"

    This warning is disturbing, but its value is real.  A thief can carry off our wealth; a 'ravening wolf' can deprive us of salvation. 

    That 'ravening wolves' appear in sheep's clothing we shall learn from the following text, well-phrased to frighten us:

        "It is not everyone that saith unto me:  Lord, Lord, who shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that accomplishes the will of my Father which is in Heaven.  Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name?  And in thy name have cast out devils?  And in thy name done many wonderful works?  And then I shall declare unto them, I never knew you: depart from Me, ye who work iniquity."

    The conclusion is that neither prophecies that are fulfilled nor the occurrence of miracles give us any surety against 'ravening wolves.'

        And in our own times: "There shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they should deceive the very elect."

    Our era is the time of Transition.  We are in the heart of this period, which is relatively short.  All the signs show that the necessary conditions for the End are emerging before our very eyes.

    This time brings with it a great preparatory task for the transition to the approaching Cycle of the Holy Spirit.  The preparatory task fundamental to the Time of Transition can and must be accomplished under the Aegis of the Absolute, for human beings and BY human beings.  Success depends upon the emergence in the near future of a sufficient number of people belonging to a new human type - torch bearers who have an innate predisposition for esoteric work.  And, it is Women who must play the inspirational role in this difficult time of Transition leading to the promised era of redemption.

    The objective of esoteric work is the march towards Consciousness, which means towards Truth.  The final aim that man can hope to achieve by esoteric work is to attain the Second Birth and so overcome Death. 

    With rare exceptions, this aim can only be attained by the student through hared and methodical work.  The sum of the conscious efforts required is proportional to the degeneracy of the Personality.

    The discipline is accepted voluntarily, but it is of iron.  The student can abandon the work at any moment to return to worldly interests.

    The freedom of choice and the initiative demanded of the seeker bring a danger: that of taking the false for the true; the impure for the pure, allowing himself to become subject to traps and snares.  When such errors are made by the pure in heart, they will be warned in time, even if they persist in their error. 

    The real danger, which can lead to mortal sin, to a definite check, occurs when an impure heart seeks to be served by higher psychic forces for its own egoistic ends.  This is a quagmire.

    A curious phenomenon often occurs in the human mind when it considers the generally hermetized theories and facts of the esoteric realm.

    In any field of science, pure, moral, applied, it is generally accepted that we must be well versed in a subject before we can give a valid opinion.  To speak seriously, one must speak of what one knows, which presupposes previous studies.

    In the esoteric domain, many purveyors of "esoteric science" believe themselves to be competent without even completing an elementary education.  They may receive all kinds of "insights" and messages from all kinds of sources, but the problem with that is that they judge these messages and teachings to be positive or true before they have even developed within themselves the correct instrument with which to judge.

    The problem is:  we KNOW that any given thing can only be conceived, understood and judged by something similar or higher.  Without this, all judgments, discussions and advice about esoteric facts remain comparable to evaluations and opinions about the shade of a specific color by someone born blind.

    Just as the world we live in is closed off, invisible to the fetus in its mother's womb until the awakening of its birth, even so the higher planes of Life, the astral and spiritual, are similarly closed and invisible to us until the Second Birth.  Until then, man can only form hypotheses or refer to the testimony of authors who have themselves been Twice born.

    As for passing valid judgments of these facts, no one can do this until he has himself crossed the second Threshold. 

    What seems clear is that it is commonplace these days for people of perfectly good faith to persist in their ignorant attitudes about esotericism.  This phenomenon is due to two principle causes.  One is the general tendency of humans to claim qualities which exist in them only in potential, and the second - a consequence of the first - is the deification of Personality.  Without doing any real, prolonged work, they "trust themselves" or rely on their own "truth" to guide them. 

    We are not speaking here of people of bad faith; we are speaking of sincere people who stray into gross error.  Their case is precisely that of the sick in need of a physician.  They are small "Sauls" who could be converted to small "Pauls," and thus might become useful laborers and earn a reward in the fields of the Lord.  But they wander in their searching beyond the place where they could receive compensation for the work that they have done.

    In esoteric work the phenomenalist mentality seeks facts.  It looks for manifestations that confirm that its work is well founded, or which simply satisfy its curiosity.  This is where the snares and traps and greatest dangers lie.  For it is often possible to obtain the desired "facts" quite easily from the astral realms, to which the human personality also belongs.  When the personality is firmly anchored in the physical body it is generally incapable of making direct connection with the astral levels.  However, certain persons, known as sensitives, have the innate or acquired faculty of momentarily weakening the ties of the personality to the physical body so that, with no esoteric evolution whatever, they are able to connect with this level - connecting to the coarsest levels of the astral.

    "Facts" obtained this way are often regarded by people who seek them as coming from the spiritual level.  However, this level is a vast reservoir of psychic entities that have no contact with the higher plane, including amongst them discarnate Personalities, who normally remain there to await their Second Death - the negative equivalent of the Second Birth.  This usually occurs on the fortieth day after death of the physical body.

    The Tradition expressly warns seekers against contacts with this realm which is so dangerous and full of the worst illusions. 

    The power of intervention of these entities in the lives of humans is a function of the credulity they meet.  The yearning to experience miracles, visions, etc, creates an atmosphere favorable for their appearance, which can assume various forms, often perceptible to the physical senses.

    In the materialist mind of the cultured man of our era, the true and the false in esoteric research easily become mixed together.  This entanglement shows above all in the domain of our affections, which are generally unbalanced in us because the habit of lying has become our true second nature.  The innate faculty of immediate discernment of the true from the false is thus lost, and man, even the most cultured and learned, becomes singularly credulous, particularly in the mystical realm.

    This imbalance affects us according to law:  credulity is inversely proportional to true faith. 

And here we must define faith: 

    Faith is an openness and trusting attitude to truth and reality, whatever it may turn out to be.  This is a risky and adventurous state of mind.  Belief, in the religious sense, is the opposite of faith – because it is a fervent wishing or hope, a compulsive clinging to the idea that the universe is arranged and governed in such and such a way.  Belief is holding to a rock; faith is learning how to swim – and this whole universe swims in boundless space.[1]

In other words, the less open we are to truth and reality, the more our credulity grows and the more we are inclined to adopt "beliefs" and rituals, often taking grotesque forms. In this mechanism we can see the familiar action of the General Law of Accident which is the essence of the Matrix: 

    To inspire the man who seeks the Way with the idea that he is already on the way.  This is the best and the most common means used by the "Devil" to turn away the seeker who has had insufficient warning from the narrow way which leads to Life.  Jesus asked:

        How can ye believe which receive glory from one another, and seek not the glory that comes from God only?

    When we accept the "glory of men," yet still believe that we are on or walking on the Way, we fall directly under the law of equilibrium.  Jesus alluded to this when he quoted the Pharisees who prayed in the streets, saying that "they have already received their reward."

    It is well understood that the human Personality, in the unfinished state in which we find it, forms our only instrument for esoteric work.  Better still, it is a gift; it is the talent the Master has given us so that we may make it bear fruit.  Woe to the servant who buries it in the earth of his body.  "Cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth."  And here, this is no metaphor. 

    We must therefore work with love and with all our strength since we do not know at what hour the Master will come.

     This being so, the attitude of the esoteric Doctrine towards lying is clear  and realistic.  ...We must fight energetically against .. useless lies.

    It is only by training of this nature that we shall progressively be able to  master the rooted tendency to lie which exists within us.  Every attempt to  hurry things, so far as lying to others is concerned, though it be a noble  attempt, is doomed to early failure.  We live in a world which is immersed in  lies and moved by lies.

    It is also necessary to guard against a variant of the habit of lying to  ourselves, one which we commonly adopt from early childhood, and against which  we must fight by every means.  This variant is widespread because at first  glance it appears to us to be a positive attitude.  ...When applied to  ourselves and for our own benefit, with the aim of softening a shock, or  regaining our inner peace after we have sinned, or excusing our actions or  faults, this idiom crystallizes within us over a period of time an auto- tranquilizing mechanism.  ...It is a true mechanism of mental anesthesia,  founded on a refined and disguised lie.  It sows hypocrisy in man towards  himself.

    This auto-tranquillizer must be destroyed."

But we see so often how desperately people want to be "tranquilize."  How  many individuals have written to us asking for an answer that would help  them feel peaceful and enable them to go to sleep at night.  They want  "positive messages."  They want a program of meditation that will make them  feel good, or something to do or "look forward to" that will ease their anxiety  when they glimpse, momentarily, the reality of the Matrix.  They want to feel  chosen and special by virtue of having been "contacted" and performing rituals without doing the absolutely agonizing work necessary to precipitate transformation.

Mouravieff continues:

    The permanent link which must be introduced between the Personality and the  real "I" is esoteric Knowledge.  The knowledge and understanding that it  permits us to acquire represent the philosopher's stone of the medieval  mystics.  They are capable of provoking in man the transmutation to which he  aspires.

    We must work ceaselessly, for fear of not succeeding in time.  One must work,  says Jesus,  "while it is day: the night comes when no man can work."

These commentaries of Mouravieff are absolutely invaluable, and would be helpful to every seeker on the path and reader of the Cassiopaean Material.  This is especially so because Mouravieff actually describes  things that  we have already experienced, even though we did not precisely  understand what it was we were doing, how or even why.

For example,  Mouravieff calls the influences of the material world, the Matrix, the  predator's mind, etc, the "A influences."  (He has diagrams showing how they  affect the consciousness.)  The influences of the esoteric center, the "real  world" concealed by the "matrix illusion," the "truth," are called "B  influences." 

He writes:

    If a man spends his life without distinguishing between "A" and "B"  influences, he will end as he started, one could say mechanically, driven by  the Law of Accident.  ...He can have a brilliant career in the meaning the  world gives to this expression.  Yet he will come to the end of his days  without having either learned or understood anything of the Reality.  And dust  returns to dust.

    In life, every being is subjected to a sort of competitive test.  If he  discerns the existence of the "B" influences; if he acquires a taste for  gathering and absorbing them; if he continually aspires to assimilate them  better; his mixed inner nature will slowly undergo a certain kind of evolution.

    And if the efforts which he makes to absorb the "B" influences are constant  and sufficient in force, a magnetic centre can be formed within him. 

    If this center once born in him is carefully developed, it takes form, and in  its turn will exercise an influence over the results of the "A" influences  which are always active, deflecting them.

    Such deflection may be violent.  In general it transgresses the laws of  exterior life and provokes many conflicts in and around man.  If he loses the  battle, he emerges with the conviction the the "B" influences are nothing but  illusion: that the only reality is represented by the "A" influences.  Slowly,  the magnetic center which had been formed within him is reabsorbed and  vanishes.  Then, from the esoteric point of view, his situation is worse than  the one he had started with, when he was just beginning to discern "B"  influences.

    But, if he emerges a winner in this FIRST struggle, his magnetic centre,  consolidated and reinforced, will draw him to a man having a "C" influence  stronger than his own, and possessing a stronger magnetic center.  And so on in  succession, the last man being in connection with another having in influence  "D", who will be his link with the Esoteric Center "E."

    Henceforth in life, that man will no longer be isolated. 

    To the measure of its growth, the man will escape the dominion of the law of  accident and enter the domain of consciousness.

Mouravieff then shows a diagram of the person who deludes himself and does not  struggle against the lies of the Matrix... who has not engaged in the work of  stripping away lies:

    This second figure, with black magnetic centers, represents the situation  where man deludes himself and, believing he is absorbing "B" influences and  making the necessary selection all the while, he in fact absorbs "A"  influences... This will put him into contact with people who possess magnetic  centers of the same nature: who are themselves duped or who dupe others, and  who have no direct or indirect link with the esoteric Center.

In both the Wave Series and the Adventure Series, we have been dealing with identifying these very influences and emphasizing the necessity of "collecting" the "A" influences in terms of "seeing the unseen" of what we have called the Theological Reality. We have also met many characters that are aptly described by Mouravieff in his diagram of those individuals who have deluded themselves and have created a magnetic center of negativity, and how they attract to themselves others with similar negative magnetic centers.

In other words, the activities described in the Adventures series - the constant questioning,  stripping, looking at what is difficult and dealing with it - the shocks of  seeing the Matrix, the "man behind the curtain," the effort to "see the unseen"  is the very activity of collecting these "B" influences which then lead to the  "magnetic center," or "lodestar," as the C's called it.

    Q: When I post material on the website, those people who resonate to the material believe that this refers to them also. I have been of the opinion that Unified Thought Form being must mean a very large group as represented in this density. I know that we are dealing with limiting terms. But, is this applied to people who CHOOSE the Cassiopaean option?
    A: Maybe it is best to say it applies to those who recognize the application.
    Q: So, if they recognize it, if they know it is them, they are part of it. (A) But, thinking in nonlinear terms, its up to us to work to make this precise. You are asking this question which implies that the answer exists. But, exactly what the answer is may be it is not yet chosen, and it is up to us to make it this way.
    A: Lodestar is a clue for you.

Mouravieff writes:

    This evolution seems a long process, an uninterrupted combat with a series of  successes and falls.  More than once, he who searches will fall into crises of  discouragement; more than once it will seem to him that he is being driven  beyond the limits of his own life; he will sometimes feel crushed under the  burden of the tests and difficulties against which he will be pitted during his  search. 

    This can be understood when we know that esoteric science in its teaching goes  far beyond simple information.  Its purpose, in fact, is nothing less than the  TRANSFORMATION of the very being of those who study it...

    In every case where esoteric science offers ALL, it demands ALL in return.  One  must pay all.

    It is impossible to reach the true by the path of lies or hypocritical games,  because in this case we seek to BE, rather than to "appear to be."

Mouravieff describes the reaction of the "matrix/ B influences" to the person  who is on the Path:

    As long as man accepts the principle of the final annihilation of his  Personality without a fight, he can carry on in life without attracting the  increasing pressure of the General Law of Accident upon himself.

    The case is totally different if he struggles to surpass the limits which it  imposes.  He then runs against the action upon him of this Law and its  derivatives.  It acts simultaneously on several planes: physical, mental and  moral.  Its action on the moral plane is conceived by man, since time  immemorial, in the form of the personification: the Devil."

We are also reminded of Gurdjieff's remarks about the "mechanical force"  having promoters and adherents at very high levels who act under its powerful  influences.  We suggest that both are 4 and 5 D STS beings.

    ...Once the first positive results are obtained those students will  unmistakable run up against the active opposition of the law and the "game of  the Crafty One."

    It must be realized that in placing himself under the aegis of the Law of  Exception, man goes against the General Law of Accident, which he is even   called upon to overthrow, if only on the individual scale.  He must no forget -  under penalty of "surprise attack" - that salvation depends on victory over the  Devil, which, as we have said, is the personalized moral aspect of the General  Law of Accident.  This is so even though this, being a cosmic law, is naturally  a divine law. 

    One must not be afraid, as the Law of Exception is also a divine law.

    In choosing it, man continues to serve the interest of the whole, but  differently and in an incomparably more efficient manner.

    During his fight against the first law, he is subject to tests that often take  the form of temptations.  ...We are permitted to draw attention to the indirect  nature of diabolical action.

    If, aiming straight towards his goal, which is liberation and salvation, the  seeker successfully overcomes the obstacles and by this shows proof of a  strength that would permit him to defy the authority of the General Law, the  latter will begin to act upon him indirectly, generally by the mediation of his  near ones if they do not follow the same path:  this action occurs on the moral  plane, and often takes emotional forms appealing to his most noble, generous  and disinterested sentiments: to his charity; his obligation; his pity.  It  impels him down blind alleys, insinuating that he will thus be returning to his  duty, that by so doing he will go on walking in the right path, etc. 

    This will clarify the profound saying of Jesus that : "A man's worst enemies  are those of his own household."

    Let us repeat:  esoteric work is by its nature a revolutionary work.  The  seeker seeks a change of state: to overcome Death and attain Salvation.  This  is the goal give to this work by the scriptures:  "If ye live after the flesh,  ye must die."

    The man who lives passively under the first law, insensibly and without being  aware of it  - even as an excellent citizen - involves himself in "The broad  way that leadeth to destruction; he who chooses the Law of Exception takes :  "The narrow road that leadeth to life."

Commentary on Boris Mouravieff's Gnosis

Boris Mouravieff writes in his book "Gnosis: Study and commentaries on the Esoteric tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy. Book I, Exoteric Cycle"

    Homo Sapiens lives immersed in his everyday life to a point where he forgets himself and forgets where he is going; yet, without feeling it, he knows that death cuts off everything.

    How can we explain that the intellectual who has made marvelous discoveries and the technocrat who has exploited them have left outside the field of their investigations the ending of our lives? How can we explain that a science which attempts everything and claims everything nevertheless remains indifferent to the enigma revealed by the question of death? How can we explain why Science, instead of uniting its efforts with its older sister religion to resolve the problems of Being - which is also the problem of death - has in fact opposed her?

    Whether a man dies in bed or aboard an interplanetary ship, the human condition has not changed in the slightest.

    Happiness? But we are taught that happiness lasts only as long as the Illusion lasts... and what is this Illusion? Nobody knows. But it submerges us.

    If we only knew what Illusion is, we would then know the opposite: what Truth is. This Truth would liberate us from slavery.

This last remark seems to me to be important. Very often people write to me and say that the C's material is too "scary" and that we talk too much about the "illusion" why aren't we talking about positive things or concentrating on "escaping" or whatever.

Well, the fact seems to be that what Mouravieff has said above is the key: If we cannot map the illusion, we have no hope of getting out of it. It is in mapping the illusion that we are able to distinguish between what Mouravieff calls the "A" influences and the "B" influences. We call it seeing the Theological Reality behind the Matrix. Mouravieff points out that the more we "collect" or "perceive" the "B" influences, and act on them, the more we "magnetize." And naturally, SEEing the "A" influences, or discerning the lies of our reality, consists in an ongoing series of "shocks" that seem to be necessary to change our center of gravity.

When I was spending years struggling my way through this material - in real time - up close and personal, I wailed about it to the C's:

    Q: (L) I want you guys to know that I sometimes feel a wee tiny bit like a pawn on a chessboard!
    A: You should, you inhabit 3rd density STS environment.
    Q: (L) I was at least hoping that if I was a pawn, that some of the players were good guys. Is that asking too much?
    A: Yes.
    Q: (L) To which statement?
    A: Good guys don't play chess.
    Q: (L) But there have been so many strange events, so many synchronous events. Is that the good guys helping or the bad guys leading me astray?
    A: Neither. It is Nature running its course.
    Q: (L) Okay. One of the sensations I have experienced is that I have had it up to the eyebrows with the negative energies and experiences of 3rd density, and I have thought lately that this feeling of having had enough, in an absolute sense, is one of the primary motivators for wanting to find one's way out of this trap we are in. I want out of it. Is this part of this "nature" as you call it?
    A: Yes. [...] When you see the futility of the limitations of 3rd density life, it means you are ready to graduate. Notice those who wallow in it.
    Q: (L) Some people obviously wallow in extreme materiality. And there seems to be another kind that is more subtle, which has to do with saying that you want to grow and become enlightened, and yet such a person is unable to pierce the veil of their own illusions about how to become enlightened, and this illusion is the wallowing...
    A: Wallowing takes many forms.

    Q: (L) Well, you say that, but it is, as several people have pointed out to me, only since we have begun this channeling project that all these dreadful things have happened in my life. My life is a shambles!
    A: "Dreadful is subjective."
    Q: (L) I would say that the physical things that have happened to me, the collapse of my marriage, the things that have happened to my children, are pretty damn dreadful, subjectively or otherwise!
    A: Before these changes began to manifest, you were deeper into the "deadly illusion" than you are now. Emergence is, by its very nature, uncomfortable. But, it has and will, empower you, we promise!!!!!!!!
    Q: (L) It is a very trying time now. I am having a difficult time just coping.
    A: And there have been others, and will be others, but that does not mean that the rewards will be slight.
    Q: (L) Well...
    A: You are on a path of destiny, and there is no turning back now.

    Q: (L) This recent 'awakening' or period of seeing things with such clarity, as they really were, and the whole picture of the interactions between people and how truly ugly it can be. I plunged into a terrible depression. I needed to get my balance from seeing so much all at once. Can you explain to me what was going on?
    A: Growth.
    Q: (L) I tried to share this perception with other people, and almost without exception, when I said to people that I was finally seeing things in their true state and it was NOT a pretty picture, they all said "well, you are obviously seeing this through the eyes of some major spirit possession!" Why would they say this?
    A: First of all, it is not correct to perceive "everything in such darkness and gloom, etc." That is merely the result of a cocoon of falsehood being removed. Celebrate the balance. Don't mourn the death of an illusion of an imbalance.
    Q: (L) Where do I go from here? Where do we all go?
    A: Everywhere.

The point is that it seems that until a person fully SEES the illusion - the layers and layers of it - they have no hope of becoming free of it. Until we are trained, step by step, to discern the lies from the truth, we have no internal consistency and are subject to the whims of the Control System at every turn. And it seems to be that this patient, time-consuming, taking apart of our reality and extracting the Truth/"B" influences is what literally "grows" the soul.

Many people simply can't do it. They can't stand the bloody mess of the birth of the higher self which takes place on the bodies of all the sacred cows that were held so close for so long. They want to hear nice stories about how their breathing and spinning tetrahedrons are going to just fix them right up. They want to hear how the "Guardian Alliance" is going to help us out of the soup. They want to hear how the Zetas are warning us that we are in danger of being smacked by a rogue planet and if we ask real nice, we might get a seat on the airlift out.

As Mouravieff has just said: "If we only knew what Illusion is, we would then know the opposite: what Truth is. This Truth would liberate us from slavery."

And it seems that the only way we have of discovering Truth in this reality, is to first of all strip away all the lies. And Lord! There's a raft of them!

Now, back to Mouravieff:

    What strikes us from the very beginning is that man confuses moral progress with technical progress, so that the development of science continues in dangerous isolation.

    The brilliant progress that has come from technology has changed nothing essential in the human condition, and will change nothing, because it operates only in the field of everyday events. For this reason it touches the inner life of man only superficially. Yet from very ancient times it has been known that the essential is found within man, not outside him.

    Humanity has arrived at an important turning point in its history. The Cartesian spirit which destroyed scholastic philosophy is now in turn being left behind. The logic of history demands a new spirit. The divorce between traditional knowledge, of which religion is a trustee, and acquired knowledge, the fruit of science, threatens to make sterile our civilization.

    Yet it is an aberration to believe that Science by its very nature is opposed to [spirit], and it must also be firmly stressed that [spirit] does not include any tendency opposed to Science. On the contrary, the [mystics] foresaw the prodigious development of Science.

    The celebrated formula of St. Paul: Faith, Hope and Love, summarizes a vast programme of evolution for human knowledge. If we examine this formula in relation to its context we see that the first two terms are temporary, while the third is permanent. [...] It was appropriate to the epoch in which it was expressed, and its significance has had to evolve with time. [...] Science and knowledge are called on to replace Faith and Hope, which defined the limits of what was accessible to the mentality of the epoch when he taught - have since then known extraordinary development.

    He therefore adds: "Now that I have become a man, I have put away childish things."

    This is how the passage from Faith to Knowledge is described. [Faith being appropriate to that time, Science replacing Faith in our time.]

    St. Paul then specifies that this last, although necessary in evolution, is NOT a final state, as it is incomplete by nature. He adds that "When that which is perfect is come, that which is incomplete disappears."

    The perfect is Love, which unites in itself the accomplishment of all virtues, of all prophecies, of all mysteries, and of all Knowledge.

    It is by the joint efforts of traditional science, based on Revelation, and of acquired Science, the domain of positive knowledge, that is, on "Faith and Hope," that one can hope to fulfill the programme traced out by St. Paul, and finally attain Love in its integral meaning."

The work of Mouravieff was only translated into English fairly recently, but Ark read them in French many years ago. He had forgotten much of what was in them because he had to read them with a dictionary and it was a slow and laborious process. But recently, when we found them in English, we ordered them and I have to tell you that reading some of the things in there really amazed me. As the author of the introduction to Mouravieff's books wrote: "It predicts, in what appears at first to be mere theory, the actual events of the life in the study of Gnosis." Mouravieff has certainly written a book that "predicts" much of what we have already experienced in our initiatory path guided by the Cassiopaeans. And this is what encourages us that Mouravieff's text consists of significant chunks of knowledge of a high order.

Indeed, even in reading Mouravieff we must discriminate. But it is apparent that there is information there that can assist the seeker to greater understanding of the process of spiritual transformation.

What struck me most forcibly was the fact that things that we KNOW because of experience, are described and explained by Mouravieff even though the experiences happened for us before reading the explanation. And even though Ark had read these books, those specific things that I want to quote here, had no meaning for him because they were - at the time - outside of his range of experiences.

Mouravieff talks about the degrading of women to "living merchandise" and how Jesus (as a Gnostic teacher) taught "reciprocal choice in love" which established the idea of "romance" between men and women. I have already noted that this seems to be philosophy of the "Golden Age," transmitted down through the ages via Archaic Shamanism, the Eleusinian Rites, and then later the True Teachings of Jesus, not to be confused with the Egyptian mythical overlay that is known as Christianity today.

"Reciprocal choice in love" is certainly a theme of the Grail stories with their emphasis on romance - on "platonic love" and so on - and it has long been a mystery as to what, precisely, this allegory was supposed to convey. If what Mouravieff is saying is true, then it will all begin to make perfect sense, even including the possible survival of the Cathar teachings in the Grail stories and the lays of the minstrels and Troubadours, etc.

Also, there is Fomenko's theory to consider - that much of the "history" of the Dark Ages in Europe is really the history of ancient Byzantium, the origin of the Grail stories, and the "path of transmission" of the ancient Gnostic traditions. That is not to say that we agree completely with what Fomenko has proposed. What is important is that he noticed that something was very strange with history and he sought an explanation. Unfortunately his explanation did not include hyperdimensional manipulations.

And of course, here is where we come to one of the big differences between the work of Gurdjieff and Mouravieff: Sex and sexuality. Gurdjieff's teachings on sexuality were quite different from the teachings of Mouravieff. Gurdjieff had said that there were three "centers" in the human being - (1)Intellectual Center (2)Emotional Center (3) Sex Center. The proper kind of sex, according to Gurdjieff, was when the Sex Center functioned with its own energy without "borrowing" energy from the other two centers. In other words, sex should be separated from the intellectual and emotional life of human beings, and love does not enter into his teachings on sexuality. Homosexuality is said to be incompatible with the Work on Oneself. Mouravieff suggests that when the magnetic center is established, it takes under its control ALL of the centers, including the sexual center.

And here we are not speaking of Tantra, as the reader will discover as we continue with this series of excerpts. However, it seems that the negative occult tradition has sought to promote the idea of Tantric sex as a means of "spiritualization." We believe that this is a complete misunderstanding of the principles.

Mouravieff writes:

    The romance, by which Christian society expressed the principle of reciprocal choice, reached its climax in the Middle Ages. In spite of the decline it has known since then, and in spite of a current tendency to return to regressive forms of relations between the sexes, it still remains the avowed ideal of our society.

    Is it not exact, then, to speak of the death of romance? A revolution is occurring silently which will replace the free romance, distinctive mark of the Christian era, with the singular romance characteristic of the Holy Spirit. Liberated from servitude to procreation, this romance of tomorrow is called on to cement the indissoluble union between two strictly polar beings, a union which will assure their integration in the bosom of the Absolute. As St. Paul says:

        "Nevertheless, neither is the woman without the man, nor man without the woman in the Lord."

    The vision of such a romance has haunted the highest minds for thousands of years. We find it in platonic love, the basis of the singular romance in the myths of Androgyne man; of Orpheus and Eurydice; of Pygmalion and Galatea... This is the aspiration of the human heart, which cries in secrecy because of its great loneliness. This romance forms the essential aim of esoteric work. Here is that love which will unite man to that being who is unique for him, the Sister-Wife, the glory of man, as he will be the glory of God. Having entered into the light of Tabor, no longer two, but one drinking at the fount of true Love, the transfigurer: the conqueror of Death.

    Love is the Alpha and Omega of life. All else has only secondary significance.

    Man is born with the Alpha. It is the intention of the present work to show the path which leads towards the Omega.

    When we ask someone who lives under this constant pressure of contemporary life to turn his mental vision towards himself, he generally answers that he has not enough time left to undertake such practices. ... If he acquiesces, he will in most cases say that he sees nothing: Fog; Obscurity. In less common cases, the observer reports that he perceives something which he cannot define because it changes all the time.

    This last observation is correct. Everything is in fact continually changing within us. A minor external shock, agreeable or disagreeable, happy or unhappy, is sufficient to give our inner content a quite different appearance.

    If we follow up this interior observation, this introspection, without prejudice, we will soon note that our "I" of which we are so consistently proud, is not always the same self: the "I" changes.

    As this impression becomes more defined we begin to become more aware that it is not a single being who lives within us but several, each having his own tastes, his own aspirations, and each trying to attain his own ends.

    If we proceed with this experience, we will soon be able to distinguish three currents with that perpetually moving life: that of the vegetative life of the instincts, so to speak; that of the animal life of the feelings; and lastly that of human life in the proper sense of the term, characterized by thought and speech.

    It is as though there were three beings within us, all entangled together in an extraordinary way.

    So we come to appreciate the value of introspection as a method of practical work which permits us to know ourselves and enter into ourselves.

    The inner content of man is analogous to a vase full of iron filings in a state of mixture as a result of mechanical action. Every shock received by the vase causes displacement of the particles of iron filings. Thus real life remains hidden from the human being due to the constant changes occurring in his inner life.

    Even so, as we shall see later, this senseless and dangerous situation can be modified in a beneficial way. But this requires work; conscientious and sustained effort. Introspection carried out relentlessly results in enhanced internal sensibility. This improved sensibility in its turn intensifies the amplitude and frequency of movement whenever the iron filings are disturbed. As a result, shocks that previously were not noticed will now provoke vivid reactions. These movements, because of their continuous amplification, can create friction between particles of iron so intense that we may one day feel the interior fire igniting within us.

    The fire must not remain a harmless flare-up. Nor is it enough that the fire smolders dormant under the ashes. A live and ardent fire once lit must be carefully kept alight by the will to refine and cultivate sensitiveness. If it continues in this way, our state can change: the heat of the flame will start a process of fusion within us.

Regarding this idea of the internal crucible, the C's have said:

    Q: (A) A related question concerning our internet activities which have been going on for some time, and we do it because we feel that it is necessary, but we don't really know or understand what is the real purpose of what we are doing. Some people are reading our pages and writing letters, and then they disappear or they are discouraged, or they do nothing on their own. We are expending a lot of time on this publishing of information, but without clear understanding of what we are supposed to accomplish by this. (L) At this point, it is not accomplishing a whole lot except drawing down fire on our heads! (A) Right!
    A: You should rejoice! From the fire comes light. Patience pays. You are on the right track.

Back to Mouravieff: 

    ...A live and ardent fire, once lit must be carefully kept alight by the will to refine and cultivate sensitiveness. If it continues in this way, our state can change: the heat of the flame will start a process of fusion within us.

    From this point on the inner content will no longer behave like a heap of iron filings: it will form a block. Then further shocks will no longer provoke interior change in man as they did previously. Having reached this point he will have acquired a firmness; he will remain himself in the midst of the tempests to which life may expose him.

    To reach this state, we must from the beginning rid ourselves of all illusions about ourselves, no matter how dearly held; an illusion - if it is tolerated at the start - will grow en route, so that suffering and additional effort will be necessary in order to rid ourselves of it at a later date.

    As long as man has not reached the point of fusion, his life will be in effect a factitious existence, as he himself will change from moment to moment. Since these changes will occur as a result of external shocks which he can almost never foresee, it will also be impossible for him to predict in advance the exact way he will change internally. thus he will live subject to events as they occur, always preoccupied by constantly "patching up". He will in fact progress toward the unknown, at the mercy of chance. This state of things is the principal law under whose authority he leads his illusory existence.

    Esoteric science indicates the possibilities and the means of freeing oneself from this law.

    But to begin effectively in this way, one must first clearly see the situation as it is.

The parable of the coach:

    The physical body is represented by the coach itself; the horses represent sensations, feelings and passions; the coachman is the ensemble of the intellectual faculties including reason; the person sitting in the coach is the master.

    In its normal state, the whole system is in a perfect state of operation: the coachman holds the reins firmly in his hands and drives the horses in the direction indicated by the master.

    This, however, is not how things happen [due, the C's say, to DNA modification]

    First of all, the master is absent. The coach must go and find him, and must then await his pleasure. All is in a bad state: the axles are not greased and they grate; the wheels are badly fixed; the shaft dangles dangerously; the horses, although of noble race, are dirty and ill-fed; the harness is worn and the reins are not strong. The coachman is asleep: his hands have slipped to his knees and hardly hold the reins, which can fall from them at any moment.

    The coach nevertheless continues to move forward, but does so in a way which presages no happiness. Abandoning the road, it is rolling down the slope in such a way that the coach is now pushing the horses, which are unable to hold it back. The coachman, fallen into a deep sleep, is swaying in his seat at risk of falling off. Obviously a sad fate awaits such a coach.

    This image provides a highly appropriate analogy for the condition of most human beings...

    Salvation may however present itself. Another coachman, this one quite awake, may pass by the same route and observe the coach in its sad situation. ... He may perhaps stop to help the coach that is in distress. He will first help the horses hold back the coach from slipping down the slope. Then he will awaken the sleeping driver and together with him will try to bring the coach back to the road.

    He will lend fodder and money. He might also give advice on the care of the horses, the address of an inn and a coach repairer, and indicate the proper route to follow.

    It will be up to the assisted coachman afterward to profit, by his own efforts, from the help and the information received. It will be incumbent on him from this point on to put all things in order and, open eyed, to follow the path.

    He will above all fight against sleep, for if he falls asleep again, and if the coach leaves the road again and again finds itself in the same danger, he cannot hope that chance will smile upon him a second time; that another coachman will pass at that moment and at that place and come to his aid once again.

    [...] Man reacts as much as possible against this constant pressure of the difficulties and obligations which weigh him down. As for the changes within him, he generally compensates for this by instinctive reactions: a fixed attitude to each situation. He wants at all costs at least to appear logical with himself and master of his actions.

    [...] It is because the friction between the particles of iron filings produces a disagreeable sensation in us that we feel the need to get rid of it. The movement of the iron filings stops when we find a solution and so ward off the shocks received. The discovery of a culprit will allow us this relief. As a result man appears to us to be constantly preoccupied with his interior patching up, which in time becomes almost wholly automatic within him.

    [...] There is an urgent necessity that man should become master of himself.

Here we skip a couple hundred pages where Mouravieff brings in some Synarchy stuff under the influence of the negative occult "tradition" which was very active at the time he was writing and has influenced many people to follow the wrong path. Without the C's perspective of 4th density and the principle of the Network, synarchy is just another "elitist hierarchy." Mouravieff and others did not understand the STS vs. STO principles - hierarchies vs. circles, etc - so must be excused for not incorporating these concepts. Nevertheless, his other ideas, drawn from the ancient sources, are remarkable and extremely insightful.

    Troubles and uncertainties are normal during a period of transition. Sunrise is always preceded by an increase in night's chill.

    Today man feels acutely the opposition between the tremendous technical progress and the obvious moral deficiency of humanity. In fact, while life on the material plane is moving at an accelerated pace due to the political, social and industrial Revolution, man has made no marked progress on the moral plane.

    Today, any being who thinks will feel unhappy; if his ability to do is deficient, his overdeveloped sensibility makes his active will all the more exacting and refined. This is so much so, that he sees his good intentions wither before they have had the strength to blossom.

    There is no reason to hope that the present situation will correct itself automatically. On the contrary, the more technical progress accelerates, the wider grows the gulf in modern man between wanting and the ability to do. This contradiction can be seen on every plane. For example, [over fifty years after] the end of the second world war, the world is trapped in a situation which is neither war nor peace. This in itself is an eloquent demonstration of the powerlessness of those in authority.

    ...Man must now discover new sources of moral energy in the same way that he has - thanks to science - found new sources of physical energy.

    [The solution lies in a network of human beings] whose latent moral faculties are developed and cultivated.

    The knowledge and understanding and savior-faire needed to attain this aim have been preserved through the centuries...

    In their ensemble, they form the WAY.

    This is "esoteric Christianity."

    Century after century, while the flame of primitive Christianity burned low, esoteric work has remained vigilant. The esoteric meaning of the work was a preparatory effort: its objective was to accumulate the necessary energies on the astral plane, and so make it easier for humanity to pass through the great turnings of History...

    These changes in direction, and the coming of the new era they imply, have been constantly notable for the varied active and eminent roles played by women....

    The principle of Woman's intervention is found in ALL crucial periods of history.

    Periods where the ennobling role of the woman in the life of human society has faded are marked by a triviality of morals and manners, expressed in particular by a taste for realism carried to its utmost limits.

    Today, human relations suffer from a real distortion in the innate role that woman is destined to play at the side of man: instead of being the active force in these relations, the inspiring and fruitful complement to the man, the woman tends to follow a parallel path, which no longer permits her to exercise her own creative vocation.

    [...] Man and woman once formed a single spiritual being - [even if in separate bodies] - endowed with the unique consciousness of the real Self; The Being described in the myth of the Androgyne.

In the cycle of the "Fall," the male dominator conceptualization, the rule of the Father and the son, human beings became isolated from their real "I." Human beings take the illusions of the "I," the "predator's mind, so to say, as reality.

    The incomplete "I" of the Personality, unfinished and powerless, wanders in life with no faith and no true affection. It goes from error to error, from weakness to weakness, and from lie to lie. A prisoner - perhaps voluntarily - but nevertheless a prisoner - man does not do what he wants to do in life, but does what he hates, blindly obeying a diabolical mechanicalness which, under its three aspects: fear, hunger and sexuality, rules his life.

    This purely factitious existence has nothing real except the possibility of evolution - which remains latent, and forms the objective of esoteric studies and work. Apart from this seed, everything in exterior life is based on lies.

    If the Fall is a direct consequence of identifying with the "I" of personality [the predator's mind, the degraded DNA state], and the solitude of polar beings separated by the Fall is the source of weakness in humans who have in this way become mortal, the return of Unity appears to be an inexhaustible source of new energies. These energies are necessary to man, and to restore the dangerously disturbed equilibrium of today's public and private life, he must seek them out.

    However, this return to the perfect unity of polar beings is not give freely. It is the exclusive privilege of those who have crossed, or are ready to cross, the Second Threshold of the Way.

    It is through realization of the totally indivisible unity of their real "I", by two polar Individualities arrived at the Second Birth, that the original sin can and must be redeemed.

    This is the solution to the problem - the need to find a new source of moral energy. We have reached this solution by means of the positive method of esoteric study.

    Man must link together the work of the intellectual and emotional centers.

    If the question to be studied and solved is of an intellectual nature, then, after the intellectual center has elucidated it, before reaching a conclusion or final decision and before taking action, man must consult his emotional center. Conversely, he must not act impulsively or exclusively under the influence of the emotional center: before acting, he must consult his intellectual center.

    In general, man must cultivate in himself the ability to grasp any phenomenon and any problem - in the inner and outer worlds - by simultaneously using the two centers - emotional and intellectual.

    ***

    The natural growth of the Personality stops long before it is complete. It has an individual limit which depends upon a whole ensemble of factors including: civilization, race, caste, family and social surroundings, education and instruction.

    Without continuous conscious effort, the development of the Personality beyond this limit can never occur. ...To take development further, conscious efforts must be made. The rule is exact: whoever does not develop his talents loses them.

    We generally seek to develop these talents through education. As long as our studies or researches continue, the Personality continues to grow, although often in a not very harmonious way. But when studies and researches end, and we start to exploit the knowledge we have acquired in this routine manner, the development of the Personality ceases.

    The most important and most difficult stage of the Way to pass is the Staircase, also called the path of Access, which leads to the level of man # 4 [the master of the coach.]

    Anyone who seeks to climb this must make this effort the principal aim of his life. From now on, esoteric work must become the axis of his existence, round which the inner and outer circumstances of his life revolve.

    This categorical demand must not frighten us. At the same time, we must realize that the tests begin from the first step of the Staircase.

    To cross the first Threshold, many must undergo the first test successfully without looking back: he must be ablaze with the ardent desire to overcome the entanglement of life in the wilderness, so that he can throw himself into the unknown in a search for a new, reasonable and real life.


On 02-12-97, Ark attended his first session with the C's and the following exchange occurred:

    Q: (A) My first question is: I want to understand what is this "predestined mission," what it consists of?
    A: It consists of following the path that has confronted you.
    Q: (A) Okay...
    A: We do not tell you of your predestined mission, because then it is no longer "predestined." You learn by experience, and as you sense, you are on the threshold of a rather profound experience. [...] We were always most impressed with his skills in this area. Do you remember being caught in a cold rain on the "long walk," and how through your upset, you had an insight that "opened a new door?" We remember 1966 as a turning point. Well, this is another, Arkadiusz, and the emotions feel strangely familiar, but this time you have the aid of others on 3rd density. [...] Before, when fear crept into the picture, you had the wisdom not to "look back," even though you had the temptation to do this. Look what has happened!

    Mouravieff writes: If the desire for transformation has enough vigor and intensity, this will fill the interval between the notes DO and Si, which is the First Threshold - the seeker will then stand with a firm footing on the first step of the Staircase.

The idea of a staircase has been mentioned numerous times by the C's, most notably in the context of my then future relations with Ark:

    Q: (L) Is Ark going to be able to help us with technology, to help other people, or to protect ourselves in some way? In this really bizarre stuff going on on our planet?
    A: Too much, too soon, my dear. Curiosity killed the cat.
    Q: (L) Well, satisfaction brought him back!
    A: Not in this case!!!
    Q: (T) You've got to let this go along. It's picking up momentum every day, it seems. So, just let it roll along and let it see where it goes. (L) All right, lets... (T) He's coming to protect you. That's what he said.
    A: Maybe, but there is so, so, so much more in store than that!!!!!!
    Q: (L) Stop!... Is that an ominous, 'maybe, but there's so, so, so much more in store?' Or is that a positive, there is so, so, so much more in store?
    A: Why would you think it ominous?
    Q: (L) Well I don't know.. because I'm scared of what I don't know! (T) Faith, we're back to faith again.
    A: What have we helped you to discover so far? Would you rather discontinue this operation?
    Q: (L) Oh, hell no! (T) After two years, you know she's always going to ask those kinds of questions!
    A: Not two years, eternity.
    Q: (L) Did I just get zinged? (T) No. No. Mirth! (J) Yes, we haven't had mirth in a while! (T) Just a little mirth there!
    A: We have helped you build your staircase one step at a time. Because you asked for it. And you asked for it because it was your destiny. We have put you in contact with those of rare ability in order for you to be able to communicate with us. Again, because you desired it, in order to realize your path. By now, you should recognize the signs... Those who display thinking patterns which in many ways deviate from that which is considered ordinary. The more unusual, the more telling. They have past lives on 3rd density earth, but not recently, but for this one. And they are not oriented to the earth frequency vibrations. [Group discussion ensued on the last response]
    Q: (T) ...It is destiny for you to find out what your path was, you had to make this contact, because it was what you were supposed to do. (L) Are we not talking about Freddie in terms of being put in contact with someone who enables me to communicate with you, so you can put me on my path, which is building the staircase, etc, etc. ? Is that not what we've got going here?
    A: He is one, but not the only one, just the one who awakened your sense of recognition.
    Q: (L) I know this is probably not the time to ask this question; this is the kind of discover, open find out, open that kind of thing, but it seems to me almost that you are leading up to say something, so maybe I can help you along by asking, what is this staircase, what is this destiny?
    A: Discover.

    Mouravieff: The four notes which form the Staircase are linked by a deep interdependence, since their resonance draws its strength from the initial impulse of Desire. This means that if this initial desire does not unite all man's existence in obedience [to the thing desired, i.e. to become free] if it does not dominate his whole being, it is better for him to stop in time and not cross the Threshold.

    We repeat: The Way is a path of no return. This is the real reason for this test of Desire. This Desire must have the strength of Thirst.

But it must be made clear that what Mouravieff means by "desire" is not what is normally meant.

    Cassiopaeans:
    A: "Passion" [in the physical sense] does not set one "free," quite the opposite!
    Q: (L) But what if your passion is for knowledge?
    A: That is not passion, it is soul questing.
    Q: (L) What is it that gives some people this drive, this steamroller effect that they are determined to get to the absolute bottom of everything and strip away every lie until there is nothing left but the naked truth? What is the source of this desire?
    A: Wrong concept. It is simply that one is at that point on the learning cycle. At that point, no drive is needed.
    Q: (L) So, you more or less are there because some critical mass has been reached that 'jumps' you to the point where seeking truth is simply who you are? It defines the parameters of your being.

    Mouravieff: The first step leads to the test of Faith. To Believe is not enough; one must have faith. Here we not that we are not talking about faith or belief in some outside source, but in the self. Here the seeker must surmount his fear of abandonment. Many trials and troubles will face the seeker... all designed to destroy his faith in his own ability to be and to succeed in finding the life that is not materially evident but is only a dream...

        Be not therefore anxious saying, what shall we eat? Or What shall we drink? or Wherewithal shall we be clothed? Your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. but seek ye first the Kingdom of God and His truth; and all these things shall be added unto you.

    The second step is a test of Strength.

    The third step is the test of Discernment and Skill. He who can see and understand the precept "you cannot serve God and Mammon" will be better prepared to withstand this test.

    The fourth step is the test of Love, or true, life-giving love, a consuming fire quite different from what now smolders under the ashes. It is a blazing sword whose flames burn up all alloy mixtures; all that man takes for love - within him or towards him - when it is not that. If we keep these words before our minds, we will immediately be able to judge every movement of the heart, and will know whether or not it contains traces of true Love.

    ***

    To live in the True, with all lies excluded, is the prerogative of the Cycle of the Spirit: Light without shadow.

    We speak here about certain human beings who have attained or who are about to attain the Second Birth. The text leaves no room for ambiguity:

        Lie not to one another: seeing that you have put off the old man with his doings and have put on the new man, that is being renewed until the knowledge after the image of God: where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave and freeman; but Christ is all and in all.

    This is only addressed to those who are on the Way in their relations between themselves.

    He who reaches Love would not know how to lie. But to triumph over lies requires an esoteric culture which is inaccessible to ordinary man.

    This highlights the important problem of lying.

    The struggle against lying is long and drawn out. It is first of all a struggle against ourselves, against our spontaneous tendencies, and against that mechanicalness that makes us revert constantly to lying.

    Useless lies to others are far less harmful than lying to oneself - and easier to master and heal. Lying to oneself sometimes takes on finely shaded forms that necessitate total and sustained attention, together with methodical and persistent efforts.

    to eliminate useless lying to others does not demand continual effort: one must simply watch to see that it does not slip into conversation. At the moment when it is on our lips a simple effort of attention is sufficient to stop it. That is why in struggling for truth, it is recommended to begin with this type of lie.

    But, we easily understand that lying to oneself, or the struggle against this kind of lie, is not perceptible from the exterior.

    When we stop lying uselessly, this will also be unnoticed by those around us. One can say that in practice, the struggle against these two categories of lies does not alter man's relations with other men in any way, although it is very effective for the person who undertakes it. We can therefore begin it without delay, as long as we do it discreetly so as not to draw attention to ourselves, and so do not provoke increasing pressure from the General Law [of accident and mechanicalness which will try to circumvent these efforts; i.e. The Predator's mind/Matrix.]

    [...] As for efforts at suppressing lies to oneself, they entail quite different and important consequences. Such lies grow deep roots. In this domain, paradoxical situations sometimes arise, some of them of such psychological subtlety that it is difficult to draw them out of the shade.

    Here we must mention the question of marriages where one of the partners, having realized that this union is an error, persists in trying to convince him or herself of the contrary. If he is of an affectionate nature, he will redouble his amiability towards his partner as if truly toward his polar "other." The absurdity of the situation reaches its limits if the other partner reacts by adopting a corresponding attitude - without any sincere or spontaneous glow of tenderness.

    The danger from the esoteric point of view is that, by mere force of habit, such a situation takes on for one of the partners, or even for both of them, the value of true love. this kind of lying to oneself can go on for dozens of years with people who are amiable and of good faith, and they entail tragic disillusions in the end.

    The man who starts to struggle against lying to himself must be forewarned of these difficulties, and of the possible collapse of some or all his greatest values.

    All should know that true esoteric work only begins after the individual has passed through a general bankruptcy and has had his gods helplessly thrown to the ground.

    We have indicated the absolute necessity for anyone who aspires to esoteric development to cure himself as soon as possible of this deep-rooted habit of lying to himself.

    We shall now look at this problem from another angle: that of the objective results which man obtains when he is able to stop lying.

    This work takes time, demands the courage to face disillusion, and needs self-confidence and faith in the self. As the seeker advances, he feels a new sentiment.

    He will sometimes feel bitter regret as his beautiful dreams vanish, but at the same time he will feel himself more and more liberated.

    His growing sincerity towards himself will establish an atmosphere of truth in his inner life. The law proclaimed "you shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free" will apply to him in its fullness.

    The word "free" was deliberately chosen to contrast a state of slavery.

    After each operation of inner purification, painful though it may be, the seeker will feel more and more fully a profound gratitude for being freed from this absurd slavery.

    Having reached a certain stage in internal liberation, the individual will understand the full value of the magical power expressed in the word Freedom.

    The acquisition of Inner Freedom is the sine qua non condition of further success in esoteric work.

    This elimination of lying to the self enables one to observe the work of the lower centers in the self objectively. This observation is commenced from this "command post" of impartial observation and judgment of the individual who has overcome the lies to the self.

    When our interior world is thus purified by these rays of the "B", when we have ceased to lie to ourselves, how then are we to act towards others?

    This problem is far from easy.

    It is written: "the kingdom of heaven is forced, and it is the violent men who hold it."

    If we remember that the kingdom of heaven is within, and NOT outside us, then we begin to understand that some force or even violence must be employed INTERNALLY to retake our own fortress.

    This is very often necessary to eliminate the roots of Illusion within us, the mother of lies to ourselves.

    Thus we see that the test at the fourth step is decisive. Until lying stops, man drags along the defects of his past: lying, weakness, self-pity, inner compromise.

    Generally, it takes time, the opportunity and the possibility to rid himself of his baggage before committing himself to the fourth step is met. Many individuals, because of the weight of their past, waste time and allow many opportunities which present themselves to go by.

    But, on the fourth step, the balance sheet must be drawn up and accounts settled. Man, poor and naked, is accepted at the second Threshold, but only on condition that he is consistent and pure.

    The essential is that he be consistent, meaning that he contains within himself true Love, which can only be revealed by the cessation of lying to the self.

    Everything false within him will be burned by the flames of this blazing sword.

    All of these steps happen more or less together in many combinations. They are distributed unequally according to different personalities, and driven by the force of our Desire to be free.

    In stepping onto the Staircase, to approach and then cross the Second Threshold, man adopts a new attitude towards himself: from this point on, he takes his fate in his own hands.

    During later development, the Individuality becomes progressively integrated with the higher cosmos.

    Cassiopaeans:
    Q: (L) Let me ask this one before the tape runs out and we take a break. What is the "ultimate secret" being protected by the Consortium?
    A: You are not in control of yourselves, you are an experiment. [...]
    Q: (L) Yes. Okay. How "long", and I put long in quotes, because we know, as you say, there is no time, but how long, as we measure it, have the Grays been interacting with our race? The Grays, not the Lizards, the Grays, the cybergenetic probes?
    A: No.
    Q: (L) What do you mean, "No"?
    A: Time travelers, therefore, "Time is ongoing."
    Q: (L) Okay, recently I read a couple of books Jan gave me, "Knight in Shining Armor" and "Replay". Both of these books described time travel.
    A: No, not finished with answer. Do you understand the gravity of last response?
    Q: (L) They are time travelers, they can move forward and backward in time, they can play games with our heads... (T) They can set up the past to create a future they want. (D) They can organize things so that they can create the energy that they need... (L) They can also make things look good, make them feel good, make them seem good, they can make you have an idea one minute, and then the next minute, create some sort of situation that confirms that idea...
    A: When you asked how long, of course it is totally unlimited, is it not?
    Q: (L) That's not good. If they were to move back through space time and alter an event in our past, would that alteration in the past instantaneously alter our present as well?
    A: Has over and over and over.
    Q: (D) So they do it over and over and over, constantly? (L) So, at each...
    A: You just are not yet aware, and have no idea of the ramifications!!!
    Q: (L) We're getting a little glimmer! Yeah, I do, a little! (T) The ramifications of being able to move in and out of time and manipulate it the way you want (Jan/Laura) And the ramifications of what they're doing to us; what they are doing to us and what they will do to us, over and over. (Freddy) What did it say about over and over? (L) So, in other words, our only real prayer in this whole damn situation is to get out of this density level. That's what they're saying, that's what it sounds like to me.
    A: Close.
    Q: (L) Because, otherwise, we're just literally, as in that book, stuck in the replay over and over and over, and the Holocaust could happen over and over, and we could just, you know... Genghis Khan, Attila the Hun... over and over and over again. (T) We're stuck in a time loop; they're putting us in a time loop. (J) Are we in a time loop?
    A: Yes.
    Q: (D) I have a question about... there was a... (PAUSE) Mankind has found it necessary for some reason or other to appoint time for some reason or other. The only reason I can see is to have a means of telling, like in verbal or written communications...
    A: Control mechanism.
    Q: (T) Is there a way for us to break the control mechanism? Besides moving to 4th density? (D) That was part...
    A: Nope.
    Q: (D) When 4th density beings communicate it's telepathic, right?
    A: Yes.
    Q: (D) Okay, since time doesn't exist, how do you communicate about happenings?
    A: Rephrase, please; clarify.
    Q: (L) What she means to ask is, if you're communicating telepathically... (D) On 4th density.. (L) And time doesn't exist, how do you communicate about events as one happens now, as opposed to later and the next thing happens, and the next thing happens... (J) How is it sequential?
    A: Translate.
    Q: (D) Translate? Okay, let me explain what I mean. I mean, we talk about 1907 something happened...
    A: That is how it is done.
    Q: (T) Translate is how it is done. You translate the experience?
    A: From 4 to 3. And vice versa.
    Q: (L) So, in other words, it's almost like making movies. (J) Are linear thought processes part of it? Is it being linear and non-linear?
    A: Part of 3d illusion only.
    Q: (L) So, in other words, if you're a 4th density being, everything is more or less happening, excuse the term happening, everything is simultaneous, and if you wish to discuss or communicate or have any focus upon any particular aspect of this unified dimension, then what you do is you kind of extract it out, project it into 3d...
    A: Close.
    Q: (L) ... like a movie.
    A: But you will not understand fully until you get there

    Mouravieff: The life of man is a film. It is certainly difficult for our Cartesian minds to grasp this concept. Our three-dimensional minds are badly adapted to ideas and facts which touch on the domain of the eternal.

    Incomprehensible as it may seem, our life is truly a film produced in accordance with a script. This film goes on continuously, without ever stopping, in such a way that, at the time of his death, man is born again. What seems absurd is that he is born in the same place, at the same date where he was born before, and of the same parents. So the film goes on again. Each human being, then, is born with his own particular film. this represents the field of action in which man is called to apply his conscious efforts.

    The repetition of the film is not reincarnation, although these two notions are often confused. Exterior man, who lives in the system of the Future-Past cannot embrace in a single moment the ensemble of his film, nor even the part that contains his immediate future. To do so, he would need to enlarge the slot of his Present.

    It thus happens to him that, faced with certain events, he will feel that he has already seen or lived those events. Some see in such phenomena the proof of so called reincarnation. In reality, phenomena of this sort are the result of a casual and temporary surge of fine energies in the organism: the slot of the individual Present then enlarges for a few moment, and some significant facts of the immediate future slip into the waking consciousness. In this way, the impression is created of a return of another time. In a certain way this is true, although the impression of having lived before is only caused by mechanical unfolding of the film.

    By reincarnation, we must understand a phenomenon of a very different order. Although the theoretical film revolves integrally on the plane of possibilities, meaning in eternity, the film of the exterior man clings to the plane of realization, that is, of Time, but only to the extent strictly necessary to satisfy the ends of the Ray of Creation.

    True reincarnation, on the other hand, occurs entirely in time, and belongs integrally to the domain of the Real, well understood as part of the broader frame of Manifestation. The human personality is not a reality in the proper sense of the word, but a possibility. It plays a role in the film to which it is attached, from which it will not disappear until the moment of the Second Birth. At that moment, it will cease to be a Personality. Because of its indestructible union with the real "I", it will be transfigured, and so it will become an Individuality. As long as man lives in the wilderness, self-satisfied and immersed in lies and illusions, the film will unfold with mechanical inflexibility, and the Personality will remain entirely unchanged.

    These circumstances start to change the moment man crossed the first Threshold. This passage can be compared to the conception of the future Individuality. The Staircase symbolizes the period of gestation, and the crossing of the second Threshold represents the second Birth, the birth of Individuality. As man becomes more and more integrated with his "I", growing his Individuality, he becomes progressively integrated with the Cosmos and acquires "gifts" appropriate to his individual nature. Simultaneously, he progressively participates in real, objective existence, which finally characterizes his being.

    This is liberation from the bonds of the film.

    It is only at this point of evolution that true individual reincarnation becomes possible.

    True reincarnation is not mechanical; it is done consciously, generally to accomplish a mission.

    Cassiopaeans:
    Q: (LC) Well, if that's the case! I want to ask about past life relations between us. I'm sure there is.
    A: Be specific.
    Q: (LC) Are there any specific past life connections between any of the women in this room?
    A: Who?
    Q: (LC) Well, let's start with Laura. Do I have a past life connection with Laura?
    A: Before we answer that, we wish to hear from you what you perceive a past life circumstance to be.
    [..] How do you perceive the reincarnation process to be?
    Q: (LC) I perceive it as you come back with people you choose to come back with, and that you choose people that you are karmically connected to. (I) I see it a little bit differently than that...
    A: Aha! We have a variance!
    Q: (I) I think that when we die and go to 5th density, that we make pacts with people in each incarnation, so when you come back, it is coming back to fulfill that pact. (LC) Yes, that is the way my line of thinking is going. But, when they asked that question, I was thinking that you have people you come back with because of closeness. Somebody may be your mother in one life, and there is a love bond, and then there are other people that you come back with because you have to resolve something to let go of that person rather than to get closer.
    A: This is partially correct. But, there is more to it than this. For example, one can incarnate on various planes of existence, not just the one you perceive currently. And, one may actually reincarnate on more than one plane concurrently, if one is advanced enough to do this.
    Q: (L) Are you suggesting that ...
    A: Yes, we are!
    Q: (L) I was thinking it, but they didn't let me finish. For the record, I was thinking that we are all part of the same soul unit here.
    A: To an extent, but you may not yet understand what exactly a "soul unit" is in that sense. And of course, there is more than one sense for this as well. The "trick" that 3rd density STS life forms will learn, either prior to transition to 4th density, or at the exact juncture, is to think in absolutely limitless terms. The first and most solid step in this process is to not anticipate at all. This is most difficult for you. We understand this, but this as also why we keep reiterating this point. For example, imagine if one of your past lives is also a future life? [...]
    Q: (P) Now, I just want to say that I think that we have all of us here traveled back in time to change the way things are now. We inserted ourselves into this time period to wake up and see what is really happening. This is 3rd density thinking, I know, but it is the only way I can describe it. We looked back on the way things happened, the way the world is now, and we have come back to change things. We have come from the future, to wake up now, because we didn't wake up before. (C) Maybe that's our "past life/future life" connection here? (P) Right, we all agreed to insert ourselves in this time line.... (L) So, we ARE from the future... (P) Because the world is going in this direction, and SOMETHING had to be done. That's what I see. (I) Yes. We all decided to come back, but there was a strong possibility that we would not be able to wake up and link up. And that's why so many things happened to attempt to keep us from getting together. (P) Not just that, things happen to keep us from waking up period! We've all been bombarded with stuff all our lives. (I) Yes, and when we started waking up, and realized that we HAD to come together to "link" to DO whatever it is we are going to do, there has to be all kinds of things to prevent it even! [Laughter] (S) I would like to ask a question about synchronicity...
    A: Wait a minute... someone said something a short while ago that is surprisingly close to the truth. Now just a moment... reflect please.
    Q: (L) P*** was saying that we have come back from the future and inserted ourselves into this timeline...
    A: Yes. That is close to being totally correct!
    Q: (L) In terms of reincarnation, that we were talking about a few minutes before that, we are possibly incarnations of ourselves incarnated at different levels. This just happens to be one of the levels of reality that we are occupying, but there are other selves at other levels thinking and doing other level stuff, and these other levels are perceived by us as the future...
    A: Maybe for some of you, but let us not get ahead of ourselves.
    Q: (P) The C's say that they are US in the future. So, we, being THEM in the future, some of who they are in the future, have come back as us, to do what we are doing, to undo what is happening on Earth...
    A: Close, but more complex than that. It would be difficult for you to completely understand at this point, but let us just say that you are close.

    Mouravieff: It is important to grasp clearly the difference which exists between the film, a mixture of possibilities, and reincarnation in time, which belongs to the domain of the Real, and to understand the meaning of this difference.

    At the time of the second Birth, that is to say, by crossing the Second Threshold, man escapes his bondage to the film, and enters the domain of redemption. He is then admitted into the sacred brotherhood of living Beings. These beings are an unshakable force: those who are part of it are no longer subject to illness or sorrow. Death loses its hold over them. They have overcome the world.

    In theory, the film in which man is born and in which he lives can go on until the end of the world, on condition that he is happy, satisfied with himself, attributing his virtues to himself, and blaming others for his mistakes and misfortunes. Properly speaking, this kind of existence cannot be considered as human; it could be described as anthropoid. This term is justified in the sense that exterior man, immersed in self-satisfaction, represents the crowning achievement of millions of years of evolution of the species from its animal ancestors, yet from the point of view of esoteric evolution, he is a possibility which has not yet been realized.

    If we envisage the problem of esoteric evolution from the point of view of the film and the different parts man can play in it, it is clear that this kind of evolution is impossible as long as the film can always be considered as turning in the same circle. People who perform in such a film are those we have called anthropoids, puppets, the dead who, in the words of Jesus, "believe themselves to be alive."

    Esoteric evolution starts when man, by his conscious efforts, proves capable of breaking the circle and transforming it into an ascending spiral. The spiral represents an intermediate state between the position where the human Personality is found to be trapped in the film, which revolves mechanically in a way hardly separated from the eternal plane, and that of the perfect, free Individuality, who is able, if need arises, to reincarnate consciously in Time.

    This is an intermediate state in this sense, that the film definitely departs from the plane of the eternal, from the plane of possibilities. The curve of life, which for exterior man does not in practice differ from a circle, transforms itself into a spiral and does not end - as it did previously - almost at its point of departure: the distance between these two points now marks a definite progression in Time.

    The film in the form of a spiral belongs to human beings who climb the staircase. Complete disengagement of the film is produced at the moment of crossing the second threshold. If man is able to do that successfully during a single life, so breaking the circle for the very first time, he does not return to it. Such a case is very rare: it is the lot of the just.

    Generally, this liberation requires several lives; several revolutions of the spiral. As a general rule, each revolution occurs in Time, and consequently can appear to be a reincarnation. In reality, it is nothing but a return to exterior life. A pseudo-reincarnation like this is neither conscious nor personal: it is the actors in the film who return, and they do not remember any previous experiences.

    However, a change is possible as soon as the conscious efforts of man increase the effect of the Time factor by enlarging perception of the Present. In a film which unfolds in a spiral in this way, the contents of the play change; they change in two ways: first in each life, that is, during each revolution, and also from spiral to spiral. The composition of the cast, the circumstances, and the scenery all change. Two elements however remain permanent: first, the general aim, to reach and cross the second Threshold; then the absolute condition for crossing this Threshold, that all the karmic debts which have been accumulated in the present life, as well as during previous spirals, must be neutralized and liquidated.

    Before the Second Threshold, every drama must be played out to its denouement. The work is hard and difficult because man constantly makes mistakes.

    The attentive reader has already understood that following the spiral, or climbing the Staircase, is reserved for human beings who have already absorbed a certain quantity of "B" influences and who thus possess a more or less developed magnetic center. This does not guarantee that they will make no more errors.

    It is true that from the time man first mounts the Staircase he is watched, especially if he makes sincere and considerable efforts. The Esoteric Brotherhood offers him a helping hand. Certain meetings, a play of favorable circumstances, are the forms taken by this help. This assistance does not, however, free him of the need to work on himself and to go on making conscious efforts. In addition, it must be said that often the proffered help is not used, because man does not listen to the advice given, or because he does not grasp the meaning of the favorable circumstances and the possibilities of progress which open before him. He is still more than half a creature of the domain of Illusion, he continues to take frequent impulsive decisions, and often turns against his own avowed aims.

    It must be understood that as long as a man has not attained and crossed the Second Threshold, he will have to start all over again. He will restart every spiral in the wilderness, he will once again have to discern the Cosmic Solar influences, cross the First Threshold, and climb the Staircase step by step. It is true that no conscious effort is ever lost, but the experience acquired in one spiral only appears in the next in the form of innate personal aptitudes, or vague recollections of people in the cast.

    We should know that, at the end of a spiral (incarnation), a comparison is made between the film as it was conceived at the time of birth and what it has become at the time of death. The balance sheet between these two states is drawn up, as in accounting, by listing assets and liabilities, followed by a profit/loss statement. This will show the result of the elapsed life objectively.

    This balance sheet furnishes the basic elements for composing the film at the start of the following spiral.

    If we could avoid all errors and complications in this new experience, produced as a result of free movements, esoteric evolution would then occur in a harmonious rising curve.

    Generally, this is not the case. Man most often comes to this idea of evolution after he has already complicated the film to which he belongs.

    But true evolution cannot occur except on the basis of the original film - after all artificially added elements have been eliminated. The latter is conditional on a return to the PURITY of the centers, especially the emotional center which - at least at the start - is the sole receptacle of Cosmic Solar influences.

    Cassiopaeans:
    Q: (L) Are instincts different from emotions?
    A:Yes.
    Q: (L) How can you tell the difference between instinctive knowledge and emotional reactions?
    A: Emotions involve wishful thinking, instincts are "gut feelings," psychic in nature, and are stronger. When it is wishful thinking, there is always psychic instinct seeping through which you can access if you use reason and examine your lessons of the past.
    Q: (L) Is it also correct that emotion can be used to mislead, that is emotions that are twisted and generated strictly from the flesh or false programming?
    A: Emotion that limits is an impediment to progress. Emotion is also necessary to make progress in 3rd density. It is natural. When you begin to separate limiting emotions based on assumptions from emotions that open one to unlimited possibilities, that means you are preparing for the next density.
    Q: (L) What about Love?
    A: What about it?
    Q: (L) There are many teachings that are promulgated that Love is the key, the answer. They say that illumination and knowledge and what-not can all be achieved through love.
    A: The problem is not the term "love," the problem is the interpretation of the term. Those on third density have a tendency to confuse the issue horribly. After all, they confuse many things as love. When the actual definition of love as you know it is not correct either. It is not necessarily a feeling that one has that can also be interpreted as an emotion, but rather, as we have told you before, the essence of light which is knowledge is love, and this has been corrupted when it is said that love leads to illumination. Love is Light is Knowledge. Love makes no sense when common definitions are used as they are in your environment. To love you must know. And to know is to have light. And to have light is to love. And to have knowledge is to love.

    Mouravieff:
    The heart must therefore be pure, and if not already pure, it must be purified. This is the sine qua non condition of success.

    All the discussion of lying in all its aspects is given to emphasize the absolute need for purifying the heart, and for beginning to re-educate the emotional center in a positive direction. [Remember, the emotions are represented by the horse pulling the coach.]

    This necessity explains the meaning of the words of Jesus: "Except you turn, and become as little children, you shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven."

    This refers specifically to the emotional life. Many have interpreted this as a restriction on the development of the intellect. This is a huge mistake. Intelligence and intellect must be developed and stimulated. The admonition to "become as little children" only points to the need for purity of the centers, NOT the idea of keeping them in a primitive state.

    Paul wrote: Brothers, be not children in that which concerns judgment, be children in what concerns malice, but as to judgment, be fully grown men."

    ***

    It is now time to turn to a possible short cut in esoteric work which can rapidly take us to the second Threshold.

    This is a possibility offered to Polar beings, those couples described by the ancient Tradition in the myth of the Androgyne.

    On the basis of the preceding analysis, the essential data for the film of any ordinary person can be described as follows: as the hero of the romance of his own life, the subject must necessarily be the star of the film.

    But he can also play a minor role in the film of people who play a secondary role in his own film. In this way, each film gets enmeshed with other films, where the same people are found in totally different situations.

    One must also distinguish between two categories of actors.

    The first are really part of the cast. A definite role is assigned to them: they are organically tied to the film.

    The second group only appear by accident in the film, drawn into the action by the free movements of the hero. This complexity is further increased because some of the actors who have genuine parts in the film play their roles badly, while others play roles which are not their own. Situations like this are widespread.

    The human Personality is an organism with multiple parts or facets, 987 to be exact. In the ideal case, only realized by polar beings, and the only effective one from the esoteric point of view, the 987 facets of man and woman are strictly polar. These are the predestined husband and wife whose union will create a true couple.

    However, the cast contains other people, who play roles organically tied to that of the hero, and who are necessary to bring the film in its ensemble to its natural end. these are friend souls, brother souls, sister souls, collaborating souls, servant souls, etc. The Personalities of each of them have a certain number of facts identical to those of the hero, for actors of the same sex, or polar for actors of the opposite sex. In the case of brothers and sisters, the number of identical or polar facets can be as many as half or even more.

    The lack of discernment and of sincerity towards ourselves, the innate desire to find a perfect resonance to the vibration of our soul, and the impatience that follows, all multiplied by the action of the General Law [of accident], induce us too often to contract unions which can only result in absurd situations. Instead of resisting the mirage; instead of waiting and seeking, we slip into imperfect unions, which are a source of suffering both for the partners and their children. In addition, these unions alter the meaning of the film in its ensemble, and so corrupt the personal lives of all the actors in the drama. Lastly, the esoteric results foreseen in the initial composition of the film are gravely compromised.

    It is as a result of considering on the matrimonial plane, or through lack of consideration on the sexual plane, that most of our errors are committed, including those which demand the heaviest payment.

    Even beings of good faith are not exempt from error.

    To confuse a brother or sister soul for husband or wife compounds very complicated situations, especially from the esoteric point of view. The situation is all the more confused when children are born from such unions.

    Life then takes on the character of a perpetual compromise with oneself. the moral and physical health of "accidentally united couples" suffers: with changes in the intellectual center due to cheating and lying; heart disease if the emotional center is sensitive and still aspires to the truth; also diseases of obscure origin, of which cancer is one that attacks the body in its most fragile parts. In every case, the condition necessarily leads to permanent loss of fine energies which, in its turn, brings on accelerated aging and leads to premature death.

    Difficult as are these situations that arise out of our errors, they must not prevent anyone who throws himself into esoteric work from finding the courage in himself to look them in the face and to search for a satisfactory outcome. If the Devil - the General Law - tries to lead us into new errors to obstruct our esoteric evolution, the supporting hand of the Lord is always stretched out to help us. Yet our minds, too rational and too realistic, often stop us from sensing this help.

    When a situation has been entangled by our errors, the Gordian knot must NOT be cut, it must be untied in such a way that the participants, both tied by the same knot, feel only relief at the disappearance of a situation which was simply a source of suffering for both.

    If the situation is resolved, the original meaning of the film and its normal development can be found.

    The ensemble of people organically linked in one film forms a team. In the initial conception of the film, this team must attain a predetermined aim as a result of the way the participants play their roles in the play of life. This esoteric aim is always different from the aims we follow under the influences of the General Law [the Matrix]

    The objective for such a team always has an esoteric meaning in fact, though the Personalities which compose it may be very different. they will share a deep need: a desire to end lies and illusions once and for all, the escape the domination of the [Predator's mind] and, in one form or another, to reach that objective existence in which man finds his real "I" and identifies himself with it.

    Here we must describe the principal law which underlies the formation of these teams. On the material plane, the greatest reward goes to him who commands. On the esoteric plane, the greatest reward goes to him who serves.

    The confusion between these two important master ideas - that of commanding and of serving - sometimes appears dramatic. Even among Jesus' disciples, the question of knowing who was greatest among them tormented them.

    The more evolved the team, the more important the task entrusted to it. History provides examples of the work of teams in all fields. the role of women in teams is particularly marked in crucial periods of the history of peoples.

    [...]Once the First Threshold is crossed, esoteric work will begin to reveal the true meaning of the film. Man must proceed with an impartial analysis of its contents: the role that each of the actors plays in it - and the value of this role - must be passed through a sieve.

    Gradually, as this stripping work progresses, the positive or negative character of different roles emerges more and more clearly. After this, inappropriate elements tend to disappear from the scene.

    At the end of this analysis, the film will contain only a reduced number of actors. but all of them are organically bound together, and with the hero, by the contents of the play, as it was conceived from the beginning of these experiences... which are pursued by the real "I" through centuries or even millennia. The play must then be played out to its resolution or denouement.

    The basic task of man, once he has crossed the first Threshold, is to shelter himself from the karmic influences which are the effects of errors committed in his free movements, either in the present life or in the past. In the past, workers used to go to some monastery or hermitage where they were able to concentrate on introspective work. In the present, our times require energetic and rapid methods.

    Our last question is to examine the method whereby the Staircase between the two Thresholds can be climbed more quickly, while we remain and work in the contemporary world.

    This means exists: it is to work as a couple. However, for this esoteric work to be completed successfully by two people, it is essential that the two beings - man and woman - are integrally polar.

    Cassiopaeans:
    Q: (L) Let me ask a question. Earlier they said something about being on the threshold of an experience. And now they say something is going to unfold in front of you. Are the two response "threshold" and "unfold in front of you," connected?
    A: Of course!!!
    Q: (L) Okay, he is on the threshold of some kind of experience. Is there some way that we might identify this experience? Is it going to be so outstanding that you can't miss it? Or, is it going to be something that you have to pay attention to or you might miss it?
    A: What does "threshold" imply?
    Q: (L) Well, a door. It's a door. Does this mean he is going to go through a door, psychically, spiritually, physically? Going to someone's house?
    A: It does not just imply a "door," but also one's positioning, and a sense of inevitability.
    Q: (L) Is there something I can do to help?
    A: Have you not helped already?
    Q: (L) But, I mean specifically in this "threshold" and "unfolding" experience?
    A: Yes! And, by the way, Arkadiusz, science is most spiritual indeed!
    Q: (L) Well, considering certain other elements, I was just wondering if our pathways are supposed to now be parallel or diverge... how they relate from this point...
    A: Seems to us that your pathways are intertwining!
    Q: (L) The use of the word "intertwining" is curious. You used that in regard to the relationship between EM and gravity. Is there a parallel?
    A: If you wish. [...]
    Q: (L) One last question: you say "combine energies." Is there any reason why this will facilitate the pursuit of answers?
    A: Complementary souls.

    Mouravieff:
    In the "long path," by successive elimination based on long and minute analysis of his film, and after new errors and new failures, man may end by finding his legitimate spouse, a fully integral polar being with whom to unite himself.

    In the "short path", man must begin by a conscious search for his polar being. If found, they can work together on the film which - in its origin - is common to them both.

    A man alone is incomplete. But just where he is weak, his polar being is strong. together, they form an integral being: their union leads to the fusion of their Personalities and a faster crystallization of their complete subtle bodies, united into a common second Birth.

    This is the redemption of "original sin."

    The system of films is conceived in such a way that polar beings will necessarily meet in life, in certain cases more than once. Only the confused ties contracted in this life by each of them, as a result of their free movements, combined with the karmic consequences of one or more previous experiences, can divert the man or woman from the ONLY being with whom they could from a Micro cosmos.

    If there were no karmic debt, everything would go wonderfully: two young people would meet in the most favorable family and social atmosphere, and their union would represent a true fairy-tale. But this is not reality.

    Obeying the principle of Imperfection, and moved by the action of the General Law, the two predestined beings will commit errors. Deeply buried in lies, they do not generally know how to appreciate the gift they are given. Often, they do not even recognize each other.

    If this is the case, then an agonizing question is put: is there one or more means to detect our polar being, and if so, what are these means?

    To meet that person, to do so without recognition, to let our polar being pass by, is the worst mistake we could possibly make: because we would remain in our factitious life, without light.

    Must not everything be sacrificed in favor of a union which is the only chance of our life: the promise of return to paradise lost?

    Nevertheless we should beware of the last trap, one we can fall into just at the moment when ineffable happiness seems to smile upon us.

    We have just said: all must be sacrifices; we have not said: all must be broken.

    If, having recognized one another, the two polar beings triumph over this last ordeal or test, often the most painful, the new life, will open in front of them, as they are then called to be One on earth and in heaven.

    But let us now return to the question of knowing how not to pass by after having met our true alter ago, the pledge of happiness and salvation.

    There is a whole series of subjective and objective clues which assist us in recognizing our polar being. The polarization is manifested on ALL planes simultaneously: sexual, physical, mental and spiritual.

    Two elements must be taken into consideration: If it is correct to say that the predestined man and woman are absolutely polar beings, this polarity is not simple because, to a certain measure, both are physically, mentally and spiritually hermaphroditic beings. That measure, that proportion, is at the same time, sufficient and necessary. It is necessary to permit every being coming into this world to carry within himself the image of the polar being; this image is expressed, in each case, by means of the organ of the opposite sex which exists in every being in a state of non-development. It is, so to say, a part of the flesh and blood of his polar being that each one of us carries within himself. this proportion is sufficient, that is, it is the absolute minimum that will not jeopardize the complete polarity, since the proportion of hermaphroditism in both polar beings is strictly equivalent.

    The second element, which is subjective, is the distortion of our personality due to conscious or unconscious deviations to which the initial film was subject during the course of our existence. Distortions of this kind make it more difficult to recognize the polar being, and can make us less willing to exert ourselves to unite with that being.

    [...] It is the Androgyne who constitutes a true Micro cosmos, not the isolated man or woman. The creation of man in the image and likeness of god was in the form of the Androgyne: this description refers to the joint astral body of two polar beings.

    For man as for woman, salvation in the bosom of the Absolute depends on their reintegration in the Micro cosmos, as Paul indicates explicitly: "neither is the woman without the man, nor the man without the woman in the Lord."

    Man and woman are in fact, incomplete beings who - taken apart - cannot reflect in His fullness the image of God who is all in all.

    it is an axiom that every man and every woman has a polar being.

    Nevertheless, not all human beings feel the imperative need to be united to their polar being. Beings who live enclosed in their Personality without thinking deeply - which constitutes the great majority of humanity - enthusiastically involve themselves in a life ruled by material influences, and do not really feel the need for such a union. For them, the polar being is on the same plane as everyone else. The Personality does not perceive anything exceptional in him, and if by some chance an extraordinary impression is experienced, it is instead felt as something abnormal and embarrassing.

    We can speak of couples formed under the influence of the Law of Accident in which the partners have opposite aspirations. At the base of such unions we often find, beside a double error of judgment, the influences of karmic debt, remote or recent. the most intelligent attitude to take on such occasions is to unite the efforts of the couple to unravel the situation to their mutual benefit. Left to itself, the situation will only get worse.

    Very special care must be taken of the children of such a union, as they suffer within the union. Everything must be done to remedy this. As a general rule, we must not lose sight of the fact that, even if it is permitted to the human being to offer himself in sacrifice, he has no right to accept the sacrifice of others. To sacrifice yourself to a union that is formed under the law of accident only teaches your children to do likewise and hinders their possibilities of ever discovering their own polar being.

    Accelerated evolution of the hero of a film via work on the self - i.e. purification - brings him ever nearer to his polar being. At the same time, it automatically removes from the film those personalities who are not organically integral.

    After the formation of the magnetic center within him, man starts to feel the desire, the need, to be united to his polar being. This desire and need will increase in proportion to the growth of the latter.

    The concept of the Androgyne has purely mythical or theoretical value for ordinary man. But we now realize that a living aspiration to be re-integrated in the Micro cosmos - the most direct way to the re-integration in the Absolute - is the fruit of a high moral culture within the individual.

    As mentioned, esoteric evolution is conditioned at the start by bankruptcy, a moral breakdown. To make progress after this, man must know exactly where he stands. He must SEE himself.

    Isaac the Syrian said that he who has been able to see himself as he IS, is better than he who has seen angels.

    what we call bankruptcy, the ancient traditions call "death." It is death while still in a living body. One must first die, then be resurrected.

     By progressively taking his fate into his own hands, man at the same time takes responsibility for ALL the partners in his film.

    He must restore the original meaning of his film, then push the development of the latter in such a way that the "play" be properly played out to its intended denouement.

    The hero, while working on himself, must apply himself to create new circumstances around him, which will enhance the unfolding of the action towards its originally intended conclusion.

    His exterior efforts must above all be directed towards the creation of these circumstances, NOT towards seeking direct influence over people. Such direct influence over people may seem opportune, but it is an error. Instead of unraveling the situation, the influence creates karmic debts which complicate things all the more. One must be very prudent and circumspect.

    Yet new circumstances must be created in a way that effectively helps those interested to act in the direction desired.

    Once again: man should seek to serve, not to impose himself.

    Patience, perseverance and faith are qualities of great practical value in this work.

    For man to recognize his polar being, he must be fully attentive on all planes accessible to his consciousness. In fact, as a result of the distortion of the film, the meeting always occurs in circumstances and in a manner least expected, generally at a moment and in a form which resembles nothing he could ever have imagined.

    The rule is precise: to recognize his polar being, man must know himself.

    This is obviously logical: to recognize his alter ego, man must first recognize his own ego.

    We are thus confronted once again with the problem of the search for the way.

    It is true that the "I" of the body, like the "I" of the personality, aspire to find the perfect response from another being. This means that ONLY by identifying himself more and more with his REAL "I" that a man magnetizes the union with his polar being.

    It is with a heart full of faith, sharpening within himself his highest faculties of intuition and attention, his sense of critical analysis taken to the highest point of alertness, that man will go in search of the being without whom he is not real.

    As it was for the troubadour long ago, it is in Courtly Love that he can hope to find and recognize "la Dame de ses Pensees."

    The difficulty we find in discovering our polar beings lies in the fact that we are deformed, and constantly distort our film by free movements. We must rectify our own distortion and renounce our impulsive movements. This explains the prescription not to act under the influence of only one center. It is the necessity to correct for our distortion, which, logically, imposes on us the need, both in reception and transmission, for conscious effort to make our emotional and intellectual centers work together.

    When polar beings meet, by what immediately perceptible signs can humans who are still imperfect, still deformed by karmic debt, be certain in all objectivity that they are not making a mistake?

    Here are some indispensable criteria that can have objective value in mutual recognition.

    From the first meeting, in the presence of the polar being, both the "I" of the Personality and the "I" of the body vibrate in a manner which resembles nothing ever felt before.

    The reason for this is that these "I's" find themselves then in the presence of their First Love which continues through the centuries. Without clearly being conscious of it, the polar beings know each other; and this knowledge, as ancient as they are themselves, is expressed by the voice of their subconsciousness. This creates an atmosphere of absolute confidence and SINCERITY from the moment they meet.

    Q: (L) Last Sunday morning, I had a very strange experience similar to what Al-Arabi describes as being in a 'state.' It was like being taken up into a condition of near madness, Ark was there [as in a vision], and then, when [the intensity of the emotion] became unbearable, I deliberately pulled myself back and I was cold, shaking and rocking. I was shivering like I would never get warm and I could FEEL my soul rocking in my body. I would like to know exactly what this was?
    A: Balancing of half-self.
    Q: (L) What is a half-self?
    A: Your starter version, relating to birth karmic imprint.
    Q: (L) What in the world does THAT mean?
    A: What you were assigned with at the onset of this incarnation. What you started with. This must be periodically re-balanced at apex of significant junctures.
    Q: (L) The next thing that happened was that a few days later, I went unconscious and Ark saw me come in the window [5 thousand miles away]. What happened?
    A: Learning is fun!

    Q: As you know, there is a flood in Poland, and Ark has to go back, there is so much that must be done, but the government offices may be closed, the court session may be delayed indefinitely, God knows what is going to happen. What is the source of this dreadful disaster in Poland?
    A: Sopophoric screen alterations of the magnetic belt overlay.
    Q: And what is causing these screen alterations of the magnetic belt overlay?
    A: Influences of Acquiim.
    Q: What is Acquiim?
    A: 4th density overseer.
    Q: Does that mean sporofic screen alteration?
    A: Soporific/phosphorous.
    Q: What is the purpose of this screen alteration?
    A: Deterrence of colinear wave reading consciousness units.
    Q: What is a 'colinear wave reading consciousness unit?'
    A: Suggest you "look in the mirror."
    Q: Well! I don't know if I like being a colinear wave reading consciousness unit!
    A: Why not?
    Q: Because I don't like feeling responsible for all these people who are suffering in this disaster!
    A: Responsible? Are you altering the weather?
    Q: Well, no. But, if they will go to that extent to thwart us, is it safe for him to go back?
    A: If he takes precautions. [...]
    Q: When you said 'colinear wave reading consciousness units,' and 'look in the mirror,' was that a clue that Ark and I are mirror image consciousness units?
    A: Not exactly.
    Q: Well, in a previous session, you said something about being a 'half soul,' and my assumption was that he was a half-soul and I was a half-soul, and together we made a whole soul. But, since that time, I have wondered about this...
    A: No one is unto themselves a half soul.
    Q: Okay, what would give me a more clear understanding about 'half soul balancing?'
    A: The soul as read as a unit of completion. It is the communication which completes the whole in each.
    Q: What are the potentials of colinear wave reading consciousness units?
    A: Specifics.
    Q: Well, if an overseer in 4th density wishes to prevent unification of same, there must be some reason; that there is something that the 4th density STS would not like to see happen. What is it?
    A: Is that not self-evident?
    Q: So, does that mean that it is important for us to be physically together to do whatever this is?
    A: Tis preferable.

    ***

    This is the Touchstone: for polar beings do NOT LIE to each other. They do not need to lie, for inwardly both are one single being, from the depths of which the real "I" issues his call and gives his assent.

This is also true. Ark and I simply find it impossible to lie to each other. Even silly little "avoidances" become like huge barriers and we are compelled from inside to reveal every thought and feeling and idea. And this was true from the very beginning. We knew, somehow, that to lie would be a disaster.

    After this, that absolute, spontaneous sincerity constitutes the basis of their relationship.

    This gives these two beings an otherwise inconceivable feeling of Freedom in Unity, which ends the impression of servitude and isolation under which we ordinarily live.

    Soon afterwards, vague reminiscences of past experiences will start to come to the surface in their waking consciousness.

This was absolutely the case for both Ark and myself. Past life memories literally flooded into our waking and sleeping consciousnesses.

    The reader will now understand the deepest reason why lying to oneself is forbidden: he who lies to himself will also lie to his alter ego. That will be the end of the miracle.

    The wonderful side of the meeting will disappear behind a curtain of trivial lies, which will rapidly take the aspect of an impassable wall.

    This is how and why exterior man passes by his polar being without recognizing her. this is why practical work on the esoteric Way starts and necessarily continues with a struggle against lying to oneself. Success in this field is indispensable.

    To reach this aim, no price whatsoever is too high to pay.

    If they are open to the truth, and if their meeting makes chords - silent until now - vibrate in harmony within them both, the way is then marked out, for polar beings, by their conscious efforts to re-create the Micro cosmos which had formerly been dissociated and broken.

    They will traverse the Staircase like an arrow and will suddenly find themselves in front of the second Threshold.

    The catechumen crosses the First Threshold under the impetus of a negative feeling: the horror of life in the wilderness, and the ardent desire to escape from it.

    To reach the Second Threshold, the two polar beings who present themselves in front of it must be holders of a positive password, which will be required from them at that precise moment.

    The Way opens to those who know what they want; know what they aspire to, on the Way and outside the Way, in an exterior life which after this can never again be detached from esoteric work. Happy are those who can be useful in it.

    The Door which leads to Life will open before them, and they will read on the pediment of the wall the sacramental inscription:

    The laborer is worthy of his hire.

    C's have said:

        "If one has the will of a Lion, one does not have the fate of a mouse!" Arkadiusz is strong willed. Must be to be seeker of worlds. To paraphrase: "I am become ONE... Creator of worlds."

Commentary on Boris Mouravieff's Gnosis

      

    Every man is born bearing within him the image of his polar being.
    As he grows, this image grows within him;
    It takes form and is filled with life and colour.
    Man is not conscious of it. Yet it is his ALTER EGO,
    The Lady of his dreams, his Princess of the Vision.
    In Quest of her he must eternally go.

    In Her alone, he will find a perfect echo of Himself:
    Of the most intimate, inexpressible movements of his soul, For in their union, the limit between the I and the Thou is obliterated.

    Since she is his Singular, his Legitimate Spouse.
    And Silence will then be the depositary of the fullness of their Love.

    To live in the True, with all lies excluded, is the prerogative of the Cycle of the Spirit: Light without shadow.

    We speak here about certain human beings who have attained or who are about to attain the Second Birth. The text leaves no room for ambiguity:

        Lie not to one another: seeing that you have put off the old man with his doings and have put on the new man, that is being renewed until the knowledge after the image of God: where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave and freeman; but Christ is all and in all.

    This is only addressed to those who are on the Way in their relations between themselves.

    He who reaches Love would not know how to lie. But to triumph over lies requires an esoteric culture which is inaccessible to ordinary man.

    This highlights the important problem of lying.

    The struggle against lying is long and drawn out. It is first of all a struggle against ourselves, against our spontaneous tendencies, and against that mechanicalness that makes us revert constantly to lying.

    Useless lies to others are far less harmful than lying to oneself - and easier to master and heal. Lying to oneself sometimes takes on finely shaded forms that necessitate total and sustained attention, together with methodical and persistent efforts.

    to eliminate useless lying to others does not demand continual effort: one must simply watch to see that it does not slip into conversation. At the moment when it is on our lips a simple effort of attention is sufficient to stop it. That is why in struggling for truth, it is recommended to begin with this type of lie.

    But, we easily understand that lying to oneself, or the struggle against this kind of lie, is not perceptible from the exterior.

    When we stop lying uselessly, this will also be unnoticed by those around us. One can say that in practice, the struggle against these two categories of lies does not alter man's relations with other men in any way, although it is very effective for the person who undertakes it. We can therefore begin it without delay, as long as we do it discreetly so as not to draw attention to ourselves, and so do not provoke increasing pressure from the General Law [of accident and mechanicalness which will try to circumvent these efforts; i.e. The Predator's mind/Matrix.]

    [...] As for efforts at suppressing lies to oneself, they entail quite different and important consequences. Such lies grow deep roots. In this domain, paradoxical situations sometimes arise, some of them of such psychological subtlety that it is difficult to draw them out of the shade.

    Here we must mention the question of marriages where one of the partners, having realized that this union is an error, persists in trying to convince him or herself of the contrary. If he is of an affectionate nature, he will redouble his amiability towards his partner as if truly toward his polar "other." The absurdity of the situation reaches its limits if the other partner reacts by adopting a corresponding attitude - without any sincere or spontaneous glow of tenderness.

    The danger from the esoteric point of view is that, by mere force of habit, such a situation takes on for one of the partners, or even for both of them, the value of true love. this kind of lying to oneself can go on for dozens of years with people who are amiable and of good faith, and they entail tragic disillusions in the end.

    The man who starts to struggle against lying to himself must be forewarned of these difficulties, and of the possible collapse of some or all his greatest values.

    All should know that true esoteric work only begins after the individual has passed through a general bankruptcy and has had his gods helplessly thrown to the ground.

    We have indicated the absolute necessity for anyone who aspires to esoteric development to cure himself as soon as possible of this deep-rooted habit of lying to himself.

    We shall now look at this problem from another angle: that of the objective results which man obtains when he is able to stop lying.

    This work takes time, demands the courage to face disillusion, and needs self-confidence and faith in the self. As the seeker advances, he feels a new sentiment.

    He will sometimes feel bitter regret as his beautiful dreams vanish, but at the same time he will feel himself more and more liberated.

    His growing sincerity towards himself will establish an atmosphere of truth in his inner life. The law proclaimed "you shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free" will apply to him in its fullness.

    The word "free" was deliberately chosen to contrast a state of slavery.

    After each operation of inner purification, painful though it may be, the seeker will feel more and more fully a profound gratitude for being freed from this absurd slavery.

    Having reached a certain stage in internal liberation, the individual will understand the full value of the magical power expressed in the word Freedom.

    The acquisition of Inner Freedom is the sine qua non condition of further success in esoteric work.

    This elimination of lying to the self enables one to observe the work of the lower centers in the self objectively. This observation is commenced from this "command post" of impartial observation and judgment of the individual who has overcome the lies to the self.

    When our interior world is thus purified by these rays of the "B", when we have ceased to lie to ourselves, how then are we to act towards others?

    This problem is far from easy.

    It is written: "the kingdom of heaven is forced, and it is the violent men who hold it."

    If we remember that the kingdom of heaven is within, and NOT outside us, then we begin to understand that some force or even violence must be employed INTERNALLY to retake our own fortress.

    This is very often necessary to eliminate the roots of Illusion within us, the mother of lies to ourselves.

    Thus we see that the test at the fourth step is decisive. Until lying stops, man drags along the defects of his past: lying, weakness, self-pity, inner compromise.

    Generally, it takes time, the opportunity and the possibility to rid himself of his baggage before committing himself to the fourth step is met. Many individuals, because of the weight of their past, waste time and allow many opportunities which present themselves to go by.

    But, on the fourth step, the balance sheet must be drawn up and accounts settled. Man, poor and naked, is accepted at the second Threshold, but only on condition that he is consistent and pure.

    The essential is that he be consistent, meaning that he contains within himself true Love, which can only be revealed by the cessation of lying to the self.

    Everything false within him will be burned by the flames of this blazing sword.

    All of these steps happen more or less together in many combinations. They are distributed unequally according to different personalities, and driven by the force of our Desire to be free.

    In stepping onto the Staircase, to approach and then cross the Second Threshold, man adopts a new attitude towards himself: from this point on, he takes his fate in his own hands.

    During later development, the Individuality becomes progressively integrated with the higher cosmos.

    Cassiopaeans:
    Q: (L) Let me ask this one before the tape runs out and we take a break. What is the "ultimate secret" being protected by the Consortium?
    A: You are not in control of yourselves, you are an experiment. [...]
    Q: (L) Yes. Okay. How "long", and I put long in quotes, because we know, as you say, there is no time, but how long, as we measure it, have the Grays been interacting with our race? The Grays, not the Lizards, the Grays, the cybergenetic probes?
    A: No.
    Q: (L) What do you mean, "No"?
    A: Time travelers, therefore, "Time is ongoing."
    Q: (L) Okay, recently I read a couple of books Jan gave me, "Knight in Shining Armor" and "Replay". Both of these books described time travel.
    A: No, not finished with answer. Do you understand the gravity of last response?
    Q: (L) They are time travelers, they can move forward and backward in time, they can play games with our heads... (T) They can set up the past to create a future they want. (D) They can organize things so that they can create the energy that they need... (L) They can also make things look good, make them feel good, make them seem good, they can make you have an idea one minute, and then the next minute, create some sort of situation that confirms that idea...
    A: When you asked how long, of course it is totally unlimited, is it not?
    Q: (L) That's not good. If they were to move back through space time and alter an event in our past, would that alteration in the past instantaneously alter our present as well?
    A: Has over and over and over.
    Q: (D) So they do it over and over and over, constantly? (L) So, at each...
    A: You just are not yet aware, and have no idea of the ramifications!!!
    Q: (L) We're getting a little glimmer! Yeah, I do, a little! (T) The ramifications of being able to move in and out of time and manipulate it the way you want (Jan/Laura) And the ramifications of what they're doing to us; what they are doing to us and what they will do to us, over and over. (Freddy) What did it say about over and over? (L) So, in other words, our only real prayer in this whole damn situation is to get out of this density level. That's what they're saying, that's what it sounds like to me.
    A: Close.
    Q: (L) Because, otherwise, we're just literally, as in that book, stuck in the replay over and over and over, and the Holocaust could happen over and over, and we could just, you know... Genghis Khan, Attila the Hun... over and over and over again. (T) We're stuck in a time loop; they're putting us in a time loop. (J) Are we in a time loop?
    A: Yes.
    Q: (D) I have a question about... there was a... (PAUSE) Mankind has found it necessary for some reason or other to appoint time for some reason or other. The only reason I can see is to have a means of telling, like in verbal or written communications...
    A: Control mechanism.
    Q: (T) Is there a way for us to break the control mechanism? Besides moving to 4th density? (D) That was part...
    A: Nope.
    Q: (D) When 4th density beings communicate it's telepathic, right?
    A: Yes.
    Q: (D) Okay, since time doesn't exist, how do you communicate about happenings?
    A: Rephrase, please; clarify.
    Q: (L) What she means to ask is, if you're communicating telepathically... (D) On 4th density.. (L) And time doesn't exist, how do you communicate about events as one happens now, as opposed to later and the next thing happens, and the next thing happens... (J) How is it sequential?
    A: Translate.
    Q: (D) Translate? Okay, let me explain what I mean. I mean, we talk about 1907 something happened...
    A: That is how it is done.
    Q: (T) Translate is how it is done. You translate the experience?
    A: From 4 to 3. And vice versa.
    Q: (L) So, in other words, it's almost like making movies. (J) Are linear thought processes part of it? Is it being linear and non-linear?
    A: Part of 3d illusion only.
    Q: (L) So, in other words, if you're a 4th density being, everything is more or less happening, excuse the term happening, everything is simultaneous, and if you wish to discuss or communicate or have any focus upon any particular aspect of this unified dimension, then what you do is you kind of extract it out, project it into 3d...
    A: Close.
    Q: (L) ... like a movie.
    A: But you will not understand fully until you get there.

    Mouravieff: The life of man is a film. It is certainly difficult for our Cartesian minds to grasp this concept. Our three-dimensional minds are badly adapted to ideas and facts which touch on the domain of the eternal.

    Incomprehensible as it may seem, our life is truly a film produced in accordance with a script. This film goes on continuously, without ever stopping, in such a way that, at the time of his death, man is born again. What seems absurd is that he is born in the same place, at the same date where he was born before, and of the same parents. So the film goes on again. Each human being, then, is born with his own particular film. this represents the field of action in which man is called to apply his conscious efforts.

    The repetition of the film is not reincarnation, although these two notions are often confused. Exterior man, who lives in the system of the Future-Past cannot embrace in a single moment the ensemble of his film, nor even the part that contains his immediate future. To do so, he would need to enlarge the slot of his Present.

    It thus happens to him that, faced with certain events, he will feel that he has already seen or lived those events. Some see in such phenomena the proof of so called reincarnation. In reality, phenomena of this sort are the result of a casual and temporary surge of fine energies in the organism: the slot of the individual Present then enlarges for a few moment, and some significant facts of the immediate future slip into the waking consciousness. In this way, the impression is created of a return of another time. In a certain way this is true, although the impression of having lived before is only caused by mechanical unfolding of the film.

    By reincarnation, we must understand a phenomenon of a very different order. Although the theoretical film revolves integrally on the plane of possibilities, meaning in eternity, the film of the exterior man clings to the plane of realization, that is, of Time, but only to the extent strictly necessary to satisfy the ends of the Ray of Creation.

    True reincarnation, on the other hand, occurs entirely in time, and belongs integrally to the domain of the Real, well understood as part of the broader frame of Manifestation. The human personality is not a reality in the proper sense of the word, but a possibility. It plays a role in the film to which it is attached, from which it will not disappear until the moment of the Second Birth. At that moment, it will cease to be a Personality. Because of its indestructible union with the real "I", it will be transfigured, and so it will become an Individuality. As long as man lives in the wilderness, self-satisfied and immersed in lies and illusions, the film will unfold with mechanical inflexibility, and the Personality will remain entirely unchanged.

    These circumstances start to change the moment man crossed the first Threshold. This passage can be compared to the conception of the future Individuality. The Staircase symbolizes the period of gestation, and the crossing of the second Threshold represents the second Birth, the birth of Individuality. As man becomes more and more integrated with his "I", growing his Individuality, he becomes progressively integrated with the Cosmos and acquires "gifts" appropriate to his individual nature. Simultaneously, he progressively participates in real, objective existence, which finally characterizes his being.

    This is liberation from the bonds of the film.

    It is only at this point of evolution that true individual reincarnation becomes possible.

    True reincarnation is not mechanical; it is done consciously, generally to accomplish a mission.

    Cassiopaeans:
    Q: (LC) Well, if that's the case! I want to ask about past life relations between us. I'm sure there is.
    A: Be specific.
    Q: (LC) Are there any specific past life connections between any of the women in this room?
    A: Who?
    Q: (LC) Well, let's start with Laura. Do I have a past life connection with Laura?
    A: Before we answer that, we wish to hear from you what you perceive a past life circumstance to be.
    [..] How do you perceive the reincarnation process to be?
    Q: (LC) I perceive it as you come back with people you choose to come back with, and that you choose people that you are karmically connected to. (I) I see it a little bit differently than that...
    A: Aha! We have a variance!
    Q: (I) I think that when we die and go to 5th density, that we make pacts with people in each incarnation, so when you come back, it is coming back to fulfill that pact. (LC) Yes, that is the way my line of thinking is going. But, when they asked that question, I was thinking that you have people you come back with because of closeness. Somebody may be your mother in one life, and there is a love bond, and then there are other people that you come back with because you have to resolve something to let go of that person rather than to get closer.
    A: This is partially correct. But, there is more to it than this. For example, one can incarnate on various planes of existence, not just the one you perceive currently. And, one may actually reincarnate on more than one plane concurrently, if one is advanced enough to do this.
    Q: (L) Are you suggesting that ...
    A: Yes, we are!
    Q: (L) I was thinking it, but they didn't let me finish. For the record, I was thinking that we are all part of the same soul unit here.
    A: To an extent, but you may not yet understand what exactly a "soul unit" is in that sense. And of course, there is more than one sense for this as well. The "trick" that 3rd density STS life forms will learn, either prior to transition to 4th density, or at the exact juncture, is to think in absolutely limitless terms. The first and most solid step in this process is to not anticipate at all. This is most difficult for you. We understand this, but this as also why we keep reiterating this point. For example, imagine if one of your past lives is also a future life? [...]
    Q: (P) Now, I just want to say that I think that we have all of us here traveled back in time to change the way things are now. We inserted ourselves into this time period to wake up and see what is really happening. This is 3rd density thinking, I know, but it is the only way I can describe it. We looked back on the way things happened, the way the world is now, and we have come back to change things. We have come from the future, to wake up now, because we didn't wake up before. (C) Maybe that's our "past life/future life" connection here? (P) Right, we all agreed to insert ourselves in this time line.... (L) So, we ARE from the future... (P) Because the world is going in this direction, and SOMETHING had to be done. That's what I see. (I) Yes. We all decided to come back, but there was a strong possibility that we would not be able to wake up and link up. And that's why so many things happened to attempt to keep us from getting together. (P) Not just that, things happen to keep us from waking up period! We've all been bombarded with stuff all our lives. (I) Yes, and when we started waking up, and realized that we HAD to come together to "link" to DO whatever it is we are going to do, there has to be all kinds of things to prevent it even! [Laughter] (S) I would like to ask a question about synchronicity...
    A: Wait a minute... someone said something a short while ago that is surprisingly close to the truth. Now just a moment... reflect please.
    Q: (L) P*** was saying that we have come back from the future and inserted ourselves into this timeline...
    A: Yes. That is close to being totally correct!
    Q: (L) In terms of reincarnation, that we were talking about a few minutes before that, we are possibly incarnations of ourselves incarnated at different levels. This just happens to be one of the levels of reality that we are occupying, but there are other selves at other levels thinking and doing other level stuff, and these other levels are perceived by us as the future...
    A: Maybe for some of you, but let us not get ahead of ourselves.
    Q: (P) The C's say that they are US in the future. So, we, being THEM in the future, some of who they are in the future, have come back as us, to do what we are doing, to undo what is happening on Earth...
    A: Close, but more complex than that. It would be difficult for you to completely understand at this point, but let us just say that you are close.

    Mouravieff: It is important to grasp clearly the difference which exists between the film, a mixture of possibilities, and reincarnation in time, which belongs to the domain of the Real, and to understand the meaning of this difference.

    At the time of the second Birth, that is to say, by crossing the Second Threshold, man escapes his bondage to the film, and enters the domain of redemption. He is then admitted into the sacred brotherhood of living Beings. These beings are an unshakable force: those who are part of it are no longer subject to illness or sorrow. Death loses its hold over them. They have overcome the world.

    In theory, the film in which man is born and in which he lives can go on until the end of the world, on condition that he is happy, satisfied with himself, attributing his virtues to himself, and blaming others for his mistakes and misfortunes. Properly speaking, this kind of existence cannot be considered as human; it could be described as anthropoid. This term is justified in the sense that exterior man, immersed in self-satisfaction, represents the crowning achievement of millions of years of evolution of the species from its animal ancestors, yet from the point of view of esoteric evolution, he is a possibility which has not yet been realized.

    If we envisage the problem of esoteric evolution from the point of view of the film and the different parts man can play in it, it is clear that this kind of evolution is impossible as long as the film can always be considered as turning in the same circle. People who perform in such a film are those we have called anthropoids, puppets, the dead who, in the words of Jesus, "believe themselves to be alive."

    Esoteric evolution starts when man, by his conscious efforts, proves capable of breaking the circle and transforming it into an ascending spiral. The spiral represents an intermediate state between the position where the human Personality is found to be trapped in the film, which revolves mechanically in a way hardly separated from the eternal plane, and that of the perfect, free Individuality, who is able, if need arises, to reincarnate consciously in Time.

    This is an intermediate state in this sense, that the film definitely departs from the plane of the eternal, from the plane of possibilities. The curve of life, which for exterior man does not in practice differ from a circle, transforms itself into a spiral and does not end - as it did previously - almost at its point of departure: the distance between these two points now marks a definite progression in Time.

    The film in the form of a spiral belongs to human beings who climb the staircase. Complete disengagement of the film is produced at the moment of crossing the second threshold. If man is able to do that successfully during a single life, so breaking the circle for the very first time, he does not return to it. Such a case is very rare: it is the lot of the just.

    Generally, this liberation requires several lives; several revolutions of the spiral. As a general rule, each revolution occurs in Time, and consequently can appear to be a reincarnation. In reality, it is nothing but a return to exterior life. A pseudo-reincarnation like this is neither conscious nor personal: it is the actors in the film who return, and they do not remember any previous experiences.

    However, a change is possible as soon as the conscious efforts of man increase the effect of the Time factor by enlarging perception of the Present. In a film which unfolds in a spiral in this way, the contents of the play change; they change in two ways: first in each life, that is, during each revolution, and also from spiral to spiral. The composition of the cast, the circumstances, and the scenery all change. Two elements however remain permanent: first, the general aim, to reach and cross the second Threshold; then the absolute condition for crossing this Threshold, that all the karmic debts which have been accumulated in the present life, as well as during previous spirals, must be neutralized and liquidated.

    Before the Second Threshold, every drama must be played out to its denouement. The work is hard and difficult because man constantly makes mistakes.

    The attentive reader has already understood that following the spiral, or climbing the Staircase, is reserved for human beings who have already absorbed a certain quantity of "B" influences and who thus possess a more or less developed magnetic center. This does not guarantee that they will make no more errors.

    It is true that from the time man first mounts the Staircase he is watched, especially if he makes sincere and considerable efforts. The Esoteric Brotherhood offers him a helping hand. Certain meetings, a play of favorable circumstances, are the forms taken by this help. This assistance does not, however, free him of the need to work on himself and to go on making conscious efforts. In addition, it must be said that often the proffered help is not used, because man does not listen to the advice given, or because he does not grasp the meaning of the favorable circumstances and the possibilities of progress which open before him. He is still more than half a creature of the domain of Illusion, he continues to take frequent impulsive decisions, and often turns against his own avowed aims.

    It must be understood that as long as a man has not attained and crossed the Second Threshold, he will have to start all over again. He will restart every spiral in the wilderness, he will once again have to discern the Cosmic Solar influences, cross the First Threshold, and climb the Staircase step by step. It is true that no conscious effort is ever lost, but the experience acquired in one spiral only appears in the next in the form of innate personal aptitudes, or vague recollections of people in the cast.

    We should know that, at the end of a spiral (incarnation), a comparison is made between the film as it was conceived at the time of birth and what it has become at the time of death. The balance sheet between these two states is drawn up, as in accounting, by listing assets and liabilities, followed by a profit/loss statement. This will show the result of the elapsed life objectively.

    This balance sheet furnishes the basic elements for composing the film at the start of the following spiral.

    If we could avoid all errors and complications in this new experience, produced as a result of free movements, esoteric evolution would then occur in a harmonious rising curve.

    Generally, this is not the case. Man most often comes to this idea of evolution after he has already complicated the film to which he belongs.

    But true evolution cannot occur except on the basis of the original film - after all artificially added elements have been eliminated. The latter is conditional on a return to the PURITY of the centers, especially the emotional center which - at least at the start - is the sole receptacle of Cosmic Solar influences.

    Cassiopaeans:
    Q: (L) Are instincts different from emotions?
    A:Yes.
    Q: (L) How can you tell the difference between instinctive knowledge and emotional reactions?
    A: Emotions involve wishful thinking, instincts are "gut feelings," psychic in nature, and are stronger. When it is wishful thinking, there is always psychic instinct seeping through which you can access if you use reason and examine your lessons of the past.
    Q: (L) Is it also correct that emotion can be used to mislead, that is emotions that are twisted and generated strictly from the flesh or false programming?
    A: Emotion that limits is an impediment to progress. Emotion is also necessary to make progress in 3rd density. It is natural. When you begin to separate limiting emotions based on assumptions from emotions that open one to unlimited possibilities, that means you are preparing for the next density.
    Q: (L) What about Love?
    A: What about it?
    Q: (L) There are many teachings that are promulgated that Love is the key, the answer. They say that illumination and knowledge and what-not can all be achieved through love.
    A: The problem is not the term "love," the problem is the interpretation of the term. Those on third density have a tendency to confuse the issue horribly. After all, they confuse many things as love. When the actual definition of love as you know it is not correct either. It is not necessarily a feeling that one has that can also be interpreted as an emotion, but rather, as we have told you before, the essence of light which is knowledge is love, and this has been corrupted when it is said that love leads to illumination. Love is Light is Knowledge. Love makes no sense when common definitions are used as they are in your environment. To love you must know. And to know is to have light. And to have light is to love. And to have knowledge is to love.

    Mouravieff:
    The heart must therefore be pure, and if not already pure, it must be purified. This is the sine qua non condition of success.

    All the discussion of lying in all its aspects is given to emphasize the absolute need for purifying the heart, and for beginning to re-educate the emotional center in a positive direction. [Remember, the emotions are represented by the horse pulling the coach.]

    This necessity explains the meaning of the words of Jesus: "Except you turn, and become as little children, you shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven."

    This refers specifically to the emotional life. Many have interpreted this as a restriction on the development of the intellect. This is a huge mistake. Intelligence and intellect must be developed and stimulated. The admonition to "become as little children" only points to the need for purity of the centers, NOT the idea of keeping them in a primitive state.

    Paul wrote: Brothers, be not children in that which concerns judgment, be children in what concerns malice, but as to judgment, be fully grown men."

    It is now time to turn to a possible short cut in esoteric work which can rapidly take us to the second Threshold.

    This is a possibility offered to Polar beings, those couples described by the ancient Tradition in the myth of the Androgyne.

    On the basis of the preceding analysis, the essential data for the film of any ordinary person can be described as follows: as the hero of the romance of his own life, the subject must necessarily be the star of the film.

    But he can also play a minor role in the film of people who play a secondary role in his own film. In this way, each film gets enmeshed with other films, where the same people are found in totally different situations.

    One must also distinguish between two categories of actors.

    The first are really part of the cast. A definite role is assigned to them: they are organically tied to the film.

    The second group only appear by accident in the film, drawn into the action by the free movements of the hero. This complexity is further increased because some of the actors who have genuine parts in the film play their roles badly, while others play roles which are not their own. Situations like this are widespread.

    The human Personality is an organism with multiple parts or facets, 987 to be exact. In the ideal case, only realized by polar beings, and the only effective one from the esoteric point of view, the 987 facets of man and woman are strictly polar. These are the predestined husband and wife whose union will create a true couple.

    However, the cast contains other people, who play roles organically tied to that of the hero, and who are necessary to bring the film in its ensemble to its natural end. these are friend souls, brother souls, sister souls, collaborating souls, servant souls, etc. The Personalities of each of them have a certain number of facts identical to those of the hero, for actors of the same sex, or polar for actors of the opposite sex. In the case of brothers and sisters, the number of identical or polar facets can be as many as half or even more.

    The lack of discernment and of sincerity towards ourselves, the innate desire to find a perfect resonance to the vibration of our soul, and the impatience that follows, all multiplied by the action of the General Law [of accident], induce us too often to contract unions which can only result in absurd situations. Instead of resisting the mirage; instead of waiting and seeking, we slip into imperfect unions, which are a source of suffering both for the partners and their children. In addition, these unions alter the meaning of the film in its ensemble, and so corrupt the personal lives of all the actors in the drama. Lastly, the esoteric results foreseen in the initial composition of the film are gravely compromised.

    It is as a result of considering on the matrimonial plane, or through lack of consideration on the sexual plane, that most of our errors are committed, including those which demand the heaviest payment.

    Even beings of good faith are not exempt from error.

    To confuse a brother or sister soul for husband or wife compounds very complicated situations, especially from the esoteric point of view. The situation is all the more confused when children are born from such unions.

    Life then takes on the character of a perpetual compromise with oneself. the moral and physical health of "accidentally united couples" suffers: with changes in the intellectual center due to cheating and lying; heart disease if the emotional center is sensitive and still aspires to the truth; also diseases of obscure origin, of which cancer is one that attacks the body in its most fragile parts. In every case, the condition necessarily leads to permanent loss of fine energies which, in its turn, brings on accelerated aging and leads to premature death.

    Difficult as are these situations that arise out of our errors, they must not prevent anyone who throws himself into esoteric work from finding the courage in himself to look them in the face and to search for a satisfactory outcome. If the Devil - the General Law - tries to lead us into new errors to obstruct our esoteric evolution, the supporting hand of the Lord is always stretched out to help us. Yet our minds, too rational and too realistic, often stop us from sensing this help.

    When a situation has been entangled by our errors, the Gordian knot must NOT be cut, it must be untied in such a way that the participants, both tied by the same knot, feel only relief at the disappearance of a situation which was simply a source of suffering for both.

    If the situation is resolved, the original meaning of the film and its normal development can be found.

    The ensemble of people organically linked in one film forms a team. In the initial conception of the film, this team must attain a predetermined aim as a result of the way the participants play their roles in the play of life. This esoteric aim is always different from the aims we follow under the influences of the General Law [the Matrix]

    The objective for such a team always has an esoteric meaning in fact, though the Personalities which compose it may be very different. they will share a deep need: a desire to end lies and illusions once and for all, the escape the domination of the [Predator's mind] and, in one form or another, to reach that objective existence in which man finds his real "I" and identifies himself with it.

    Here we must describe the principal law which underlies the formation of these teams. On the material plane, the greatest reward goes to him who commands. On the esoteric plane, the greatest reward goes to him who serves.

    The confusion between these two important master ideas - that of commanding and of serving - sometimes appears dramatic. Even among Jesus' disciples, the question of knowing who was greatest among them tormented them.

    The more evolved the team, the more important the task entrusted to it. History provides examples of the work of teams in all fields. the role of women in teams is particularly marked in crucial periods of the history of peoples.

    [...]Once the First Threshold is crossed, esoteric work will begin to reveal the true meaning of the film. Man must proceed with an impartial analysis of its contents: the role that each of the actors plays in it - and the value of this role - must be passed through a sieve.

    Gradually, as this stripping work progresses, the positive or negative character of different roles emerges more and more clearly. After this, inappropriate elements tend to disappear from the scene.

    At the end of this analysis, the film will contain only a reduced number of actors. but all of them are organically bound together, and with the hero, by the contents of the play, as it was conceived from the beginning of these experiences... which are pursued by the real "I" through centuries or even millennia. The play must then be played out to its resolution or denouement.

    The basic task of man, once he has crossed the first Threshold, is to shelter himself from the karmic influences which are the effects of errors committed in his free movements, either in the present life or in the past. In the past, workers used to go to some monastery or hermitage where they were able to concentrate on introspective work. In the present, our times require energetic and rapid methods.

    Our last question is to examine the method whereby the Staircase between the two Thresholds can be climbed more quickly, while we remain and work in the contemporary world.

    This means exists: it is to work as a couple. However, for this esoteric work to be completed successfully by two people, it is essential that the two beings - man and woman - are integrally polar.

    Cassiopaeans:
    Q: (L) Let me ask a question. Earlier they said something about being on the threshold of an experience. And now they say something is going to unfold in front of you. Are the two response "threshold" and "unfold in front of you," connected?
    A: Of course!!!
    Q: (L) Okay, he is on the threshold of some kind of experience. Is there some way that we might identify this experience? Is it going to be so outstanding that you can't miss it? Or, is it going to be something that you have to pay attention to or you might miss it?
    A: What does "threshold" imply?
    Q: (L) Well, a door. It's a door. Does this mean he is going to go through a door, psychically, spiritually, physically? Going to someone's house?
    A: It does not just imply a "door," but also one's positioning, and a sense of inevitability.
    Q: (L) Is there something I can do to help?
    A: Have you not helped already?
    Q: (L) But, I mean specifically in this "threshold" and "unfolding" experience?
    A: Yes! And, by the way, Arkadiusz, science is most spiritual indeed!
    Q: (L) Well, considering certain other elements, I was just wondering if our pathways are supposed to now be parallel or diverge... how they relate from this point...
    A: Seems to us that your pathways are intertwining!
    Q: (L) The use of the word "intertwining" is curious. You used that in regard to the relationship between EM and gravity. Is there a parallel?
    A: If you wish. [...]
    Q: (L) One last question: you say "combine energies." Is there any reason why this will facilitate the pursuit of answers?
    A: Complementary souls.

    Mouravieff:
    In the "long path," by successive elimination based on long and minute analysis of his film, and after new errors and new failures, man may end by finding his legitimate spouse, a fully integral polar being with whom to unite himself.

    In the "short path", man must begin by a conscious search for his polar being. If found, they can work together on the film which - in its origin - is common to them both.

    A man alone is incomplete. But just where he is weak, his polar being is strong. together, they form an integral being: their union leads to the fusion of their Personalities and a faster crystallization of their complete subtle bodies, united into a common second Birth.

    This is the redemption of "original sin."

    The system of films is conceived in such a way that polar beings will necessarily meet in life, in certain cases more than once. Only the confused ties contracted in this life by each of them, as a result of their free movements, combined with the karmic consequences of one or more previous experiences, can divert the man or woman from the ONLY being with whom they could from a Micro cosmos.

    If there were no karmic debt, everything would go wonderfully: two young people would meet in the most favorable family and social atmosphere, and their union would represent a true fairy-tale. But this is not reality.

    Obeying the principle of Imperfection, and moved by the action of the General Law, the two predestined beings will commit errors. Deeply buried in lies, they do not generally know how to appreciate the gift they are given. Often, they do not even recognize each other.

    If this is the case, then an agonizing question is put: is there one or more means to detect our polar being, and if so, what are these means?

    To meet that person, to do so without recognition, to let our polar being pass by, is the worst mistake we could possibly make: because we would remain in our factitious life, without light.

    Must not everything be sacrificed in favor of a union which is the only chance of our life: the promise of return to paradise lost?

    Nevertheless we should beware of the last trap, one we can fall into just at the moment when ineffable happiness seems to smile upon us.

    We have just said: all must be sacrifices; we have not said: all must be broken.

    If, having recognized one another, the two polar beings triumph over this last ordeal or test, often the most painful, the new life, will open in front of them, as they are then called to be One on earth and in heaven.

    But let us now return to the question of knowing how not to pass by after having met our true alter ago, the pledge of happiness and salvation.

    There is a whole series of subjective and objective clues which assist us in recognizing our polar being. The polarization is manifested on ALL planes simultaneously: sexual, physical, mental and spiritual.

    Two elements must be taken into consideration: If it is correct to say that the predestined man and woman are absolutely polar beings, this polarity is not simple because, to a certain measure, both are physically, mentally and spiritually hermaphroditic beings. That measure, that proportion, is at the same time, sufficient and necessary. It is necessary to permit every being coming into this world to carry within himself the image of the polar being; this image is expressed, in each case, by means of the organ of the opposite sex which exists in every being in a state of non-development. It is, so to say, a part of the flesh and blood of his polar being that each one of us carries within himself. this proportion is sufficient, that is, it is the absolute minimum that will not jeopardize the complete polarity, since the proportion of hermaphroditism in both polar beings is strictly equivalent.

    The second element, which is subjective, is the distortion of our personality due to conscious or unconscious deviations to which the initial film was subject during the course of our existence. Distortions of this kind make it more difficult to recognize the polar being, and can make us less willing to exert ourselves to unite with that being.

    [...] It is the Androgyne who constitutes a true Micro cosmos, not the isolated man or woman. The creation of man in the image and likeness of god was in the form of the Androgyne: this description refers to the joint astral body of two polar beings.

    For man as for woman, salvation in the bosom of the Absolute depends on their reintegration in the Micro cosmos, as Paul indicates explicitly: "neither is the woman without the man, nor the man without the woman in the Lord."

    Man and woman are in fact, incomplete beings who - taken apart - cannot reflect in His fullness the image of God who is all in all.

    it is an axiom that every man and every woman has a polar being.

    Nevertheless, not all human beings feel the imperative need to be united to their polar being. Beings who live enclosed in their Personality without thinking deeply - which constitutes the great majority of humanity - enthusiastically involve themselves in a life ruled by material influences, and do not really feel the need for such a union. For them, the polar being is on the same plane as everyone else. The Personality does not perceive anything exceptional in him, and if by some chance an extraordinary impression is experienced, it is instead felt as something abnormal and embarrassing.

    We can speak of couples formed under the influence of the Law of Accident in which the partners have opposite aspirations. At the base of such unions we often find, beside a double error of judgment, the influences of karmic debt, remote or recent. the most intelligent attitude to take on such occasions is to unite the efforts of the couple to unravel the situation to their mutual benefit. Left to itself, the situation will only get worse.

    Very special care must be taken of the children of such a union, as they suffer within the union. Everything must be done to remedy this. As a general rule, we must not lose sight of the fact that, even if it is permitted to the human being to offer himself in sacrifice, he has no right to accept the sacrifice of others. To sacrifice yourself to a union that is formed under the law of accident only teaches your children to do likewise and hinders their possibilities of ever discovering their own polar being.

    Accelerated evolution of the hero of a film via work on the self - i.e. purification - brings him ever nearer to his polar being. At the same time, it automatically removes from the film those personalities who are not organically integral.

    After the formation of the magnetic center within him, man starts to feel the desire, the need, to be united to his polar being. This desire and need will increase in proportion to the growth of the latter.

    The concept of the Androgyne has purely mythical or theoretical value for ordinary man. But we now realize that a living aspiration to be re-integrated in the Micro cosmos - the most direct way to the re-integration in the Absolute - is the fruit of a high moral culture within the individual.

    As mentioned, esoteric evolution is conditioned at the start by bankruptcy, a moral breakdown. To make progress after this, man must know exactly where he stands. He must SEE himself.

    Isaac the Syrian said that he who has been able to see himself as he IS, is better than he who has seen angels.

    what we call bankruptcy, the ancient traditions call "death." It is death while still in a living body. One must first die, then be resurrected.

     By progressively taking his fate into his own hands, man at the same time takes responsibility for ALL the partners in his film.

    He must restore the original meaning of his film, then push the development of the latter in such a way that the "play" be properly played out to its intended denouement.

    The hero, while working on himself, must apply himself to create new circumstances around him, which will enhance the unfolding of the action towards its originally intended conclusion.

    His exterior efforts must above all be directed towards the creation of these circumstances, NOT towards seeking direct influence over people. Such direct influence over people may seem opportune, but it is an error. Instead of unraveling the situation, the influence creates karmic debts which complicate things all the more. One must be very prudent and circumspect.

    Yet new circumstances must be created in a way that effectively helps those interested to act in the direction desired.

    Once again: man should seek to serve, not to impose himself.

    Patience, perseverance and faith are qualities of great practical value in this work.

    For man to recognize his polar being, he must be fully attentive on all planes accessible to his consciousness. In fact, as a result of the distortion of the film, the meeting always occurs in circumstances and in a manner least expected, generally at a moment and in a form which resembles nothing he could ever have imagined.

    The rule is precise: to recognize his polar being, man must know himself.

    This is obviously logical: to recognize his alter ego, man must first recognize his own ego.

    We are thus confronted once again with the problem of the search for the way.

    It is true that the "I" of the body, like the "I" of the personality, aspire to find the perfect response from another being. This means that ONLY by identifying himself more and more with his REAL "I" that a man magnetizes the union with his polar being.

    It is with a heart full of faith, sharpening within himself his highest faculties of intuition and attention, his sense of critical analysis taken to the highest point of alertness, that man will go in search of the being without whom he is not real.

    As it was for the troubadour long ago, it is in Courtly Love that he can hope to find and recognize "la Dame de ses Pensees."

    The difficulty we find in discovering our polar beings lies in the fact that we are deformed, and constantly distort our film by free movements. We must rectify our own distortion and renounce our impulsive movements. This explains the prescription not to act under the influence of only one center. It is the necessity to correct for our distortion, which, logically, imposes on us the need, both in reception and transmission, for conscious effort to make our emotional and intellectual centers work together.

    When polar beings meet, by what immediately perceptible signs can humans who are still imperfect, still deformed by karmic debt, be certain in all objectivity that they are not making a mistake?

    Here are some indispensable criteria that can have objective value in mutual recognition.

    From the first meeting, in the presence of the polar being, both the "I" of the Personality and the "I" of the body vibrate in a manner which resembles nothing ever felt before.

    The reason for this is that these "I's" find themselves then in the presence of their First Love which continues through the centuries. Without clearly being conscious of it, the polar beings know each other; and this knowledge, as ancient as they are themselves, is expressed by the voice of their subconsciousness. This creates an atmosphere of absolute confidence and SINCERITY from the moment they meet.

    Q: (L) Last Sunday morning, I had a very strange experience similar to what Al-Arabi describes as being in a 'state.' It was like being taken up into a condition of near madness, Ark was there [as in a vision], and then, when [the intensity of the emotion] became unbearable, I deliberately pulled myself back and I was cold, shaking and rocking. I was shivering like I would never get warm and I could FEEL my soul rocking in my body. I would like to know exactly what this was?
    A: Balancing of half-self.
    Q: (L) What is a half-self?
    A: Your starter version, relating to birth karmic imprint.
    Q: (L) What in the world does THAT mean?
    A: What you were assigned with at the onset of this incarnation. What you started with. This must be periodically re-balanced at apex of significant junctures.
    Q: (L) The next thing that happened was that a few days later, I went unconscious and Ark saw me come in the window [5 thousand miles away]. What happened?
    A: Learning is fun!

    Q: As you know, there is a flood in Poland, and Ark has to go back, there is so much that must be done, but the government offices may be closed, the court session may be delayed indefinitely, God knows what is going to happen. What is the source of this dreadful disaster in Poland?
    A: Sopophoric screen alterations of the magnetic belt overlay.
    Q: And what is causing these screen alterations of the magnetic belt overlay?
    A: Influences of Acquiim.
    Q: What is Acquiim?
    A: 4th density overseer.
    Q: Does that mean sporofic screen alteration?
    A: Soporific/phosphorous.
    Q: What is the purpose of this screen alteration?
    A: Deterrence of colinear wave reading consciousness units.
    Q: What is a 'colinear wave reading consciousness unit?'
    A: Suggest you "look in the mirror."
    Q: Well! I don't know if I like being a colinear wave reading consciousness unit!
    A: Why not?
    Q: Because I don't like feeling responsible for all these people who are suffering in this disaster!
    A: Responsible? Are you altering the weather?
    Q: Well, no. But, if they will go to that extent to thwart us, is it safe for him to go back?
    A: If he takes precautions. [...]
    Q: When you said 'colinear wave reading consciousness units,' and 'look in the mirror,' was that a clue that Ark and I are mirror image consciousness units?
    A: Not exactly.
    Q: Well, in a previous session, you said something about being a 'half soul,' and my assumption was that he was a half-soul and I was a half-soul, and together we made a whole soul. But, since that time, I have wondered about this...
    A: No one is unto themselves a half soul.
    Q: Okay, what would give me a more clear understanding about 'half soul balancing?'
    A: The soul as read as a unit of completion. It is the communication which completes the whole in each.
    Q: What are the potentials of colinear wave reading consciousness units?
    A: Specifics.
    Q: Well, if an overseer in 4th density wishes to prevent unification of same, there must be some reason; that there is something that the 4th density STS would not like to see happen. What is it?
    A: Is that not self-evident?
    Q: So, does that mean that it is important for us to be physically together to do whatever this is?
    A: Tis preferable.

    ***

    This is the Touchstone: for polar beings do NOT LIE to each other. They do not need to lie, for inwardly both are one single being, from the depths of which the real "I" issues his call and gives his assent.

This is also true. Ark and I simply find it impossible to lie to each other. Even silly little "avoidances" become like huge barriers and we are compelled from inside to reveal every thought and feeling and idea. And this was true from the very beginning. We knew, somehow, that to lie would be a disaster.

    After this, that absolute, spontaneous sincerity constitutes the basis of their relationship.

    This gives these two beings an otherwise inconceivable feeling of Freedom in Unity, which ends the impression of servitude and isolation under which we ordinarily live.

    Soon afterwards, vague reminiscences of past experiences will start to come to the surface in their waking consciousness.

This was absolutely the case for both Ark and myself. Past life memories literally flooded into our waking and sleeping consciousnesses.

    The reader will now understand the deepest reason why lying to oneself is forbidden: he who lies to himself will also lie to his alter ego. That will be the end of the miracle.

    The wonderful side of the meeting will disappear behind a curtain of trivial lies, which will rapidly take the aspect of an impassable wall.

    This is how and why exterior man passes by his polar being without recognizing her. this is why practical work on the esoteric Way starts and necessarily continues with a struggle against lying to oneself. Success in this field is indispensable.

    To reach this aim, no price whatsoever is too high to pay.

    If they are open to the truth, and if their meeting makes chords - silent until now - vibrate in harmony within them both, the way is then marked out, for polar beings, by their conscious efforts to re-create the Micro cosmos which had formerly been dissociated and broken.

    They will traverse the Staircase like an arrow and will suddenly find themselves in front of the second Threshold.

    The catechumen crosses the First Threshold under the impetus of a negative feeling: the horror of life in the wilderness, and the ardent desire to escape from it.

    To reach the Second Threshold, the two polar beings who present themselves in front of it must be holders of a positive password, which will be required from them at that precise moment.

    The Way opens to those who know what they want; know what they aspire to, on the Way and outside the Way, in an exterior life which after this can never again be detached from esoteric work. Happy are those who can be useful in it.

    The Door which leads to Life will open before them, and they will read on the pediment of the wall the sacramental inscription:

    The laborer is worthy of his hire.

    C's have said:

        "If one has the will of a Lion, one does not have the fate of a mouse!" Arkadiusz is strong willed. Must be to be seeker of worlds. To paraphrase: "I am become ONE... Creator of worlds."

Part 5


	
Article - Laura Knight-Jadczyk
Commentary on Boris Mouravieff's Gnosis

    Based on our extensive scientific research, the planet is about to "rock and  roll" - we figure about 2009 give or take six months - and this is the material  manifestation of the "cyclic event" of the "cosmic shock," so to say.  

    Having now Mouravieff's piece of the puzzle, I have just assembled from my  notes a little book (well, maybe not so little) entitled "Ancient Science,"  I will send you  a copy for review.  I will paste in here part of the introduction which serves  to explicate some of our ideas:

    After over thirty years of research, the one thing that has become evident is  that the energies of Creation emanate "downward," and our individuality as  human beings is merely an expression of the "Theological Dramas," so to say.   To attempt to exert our will or to make our voice travel "upward," against  Creation results only in a clash of forces.   It is, in essence, an attempt to  violate the Free Will of Creation, i.e. Hubris.  This is why praying for  material changes, rituals designed to "change" reality, "positive thinking"  with the "intent" to change something "up there," in order to receive the  benefits "down here," is always doomed to produce more strife, misery and  suffering globally.  "Seek ye first the kingdom of Heaven..." and this kingdom  is - or CAN be - within.

    In other words, what we CAN do is to prepare ourselves for the emanations that  are traveling "downward" to be better received.  This is the essential point of  Castaneda's Don Juan when he said:

    One of the greatest accomplishments of the seers of the Conquest was a  construct he called the three-phase progression.  By understanding the nature  of man, they were able to reach the incontestable conclusion that if seers can  hold their own in facing [human] petty tyrants, they can certainly face the  unknown with impunity, and then they can even stand the presence of the  unknowable.

     

    The average man's reaction is to think that the order of that statement should  be reversed," he went on. "A seer who can hold his own in the face of the  unknown can certainly face petty tyrants. But that's not so. What destroyed the  superb seers of ancient times was that assumption. We know better now. We know  that nothing can temper the spirit of a warrior as much as the challenge of  dealing with impossible people in positions of power. Only under those  conditions can warriors acquire the sobriety and serenity to stand the pressure  of the unknowable.11 Castaneda, Carlos, The Fire From Within

     

    All around us we see the results of this error: the idea that we can exert our  will and voice upward to change what is "above" us in order to change our  reality.  This idea is at the root of rites and rituals, demanding, pleading,  visualizations, "workings," and so forth.  When people think that "meditating  on compassion," or "feeling the feelings of all beings," is going to result in  the "sonic entrainment of the heart's rhythm [being] braided into more complex  and coherent patterns," which will then enable the person to "create a diamond  imperishable body for use as a teaching vehicle down here on earth," has missed  the entire point.  To compare such ideas to the true work of Seeker of  Ascension is simply ignorant.

    An extensive study of the historical literature shows that those who actually  MAY HAVE achieved Ascension don't just sit down one day and meditate on  compassion or the feeling of oneness and "boom!" experience an "implosive soul  force."  Before Ascension can ever achieved the point of being able to think  even momentarily about "the oneness of all beings," or the "feelings of all  beings," the REAL seekers have spent many, many years in the struggle to "face  petty tyrants," or to fully REALIZE objective reality.  He has repeatedly  exposed himself to as many "unpleasant experiences" as he can find, all the  while struggling to master his emotions, his desires, his physicality.  It is  the work of making the physical vehicle "down here," receptive to whatever may  be "up there," as opposed to trying to forcibly create something "up there," in  order to have it "down here." 

    Nevertheless, the many teachers of ascension continue to expound on the subject  by saying such interesting things as: "It is possible to ascend physically as  Jesus and the other masters demonstrated.  In this process, the physical cells  are all expanded into a higher frequency.  The physical body begins to glow  from within and radiate light.  Much as the blades of a fan seem to "disappear"  as they rotate faster and faster, a body that is vibrating at higher  frequencies seems to disappear from the third dimension. Its primary focus is  on a higher dimension. It seems "magical" to those who remain focused on the  denser third dimension, but it is a perfectly natural process."

    Unfortunately, such promulgators of wisdom do not seem to be able to  demonstrate what they are teaching.  But nobody usually notices that part  because they are too busy having "spiritual experiences" produced by any number  of "techniques" which make them "feel good" long enough to whip out the credit  card or sign the check.  A considerable period of time is required to finally  come to the realization that techniques that relieve stress or produce "good  feelings," have done nothing to actually change their lives or their  "vibrations."  They are still recognized by their neighbor's dog, they still  find new gray hairs on their heads, and they still get sick and have aches and  pains like everyone else.  And they still "die in their sins."

    What the modern day seekers of ascension are looking for - whether they realize  it or not - is the age-old quest.  Those who are not familiar with the  extensive literature don't realize that the Quest for the Holy Grail and the  Great Work of Alchemy are described in almost the same terms.  This means that  the Quest for the Holy Grail and the Work of the Alchemists hold many clues for  us as to the REAL WORK OF ASCENSION.  Repeatedly they present allegories of  struggle, deception, battles with dragons, deceivers, and evil forces of all  kinds.  The story o the Knight who slays the Dragon and rescues the Princess  from the Tower after years of seeking, struggling, suffering and overcoming, is  an allegory that is as valid to day as it was in ages past.  It is the TRUE  PATH OF ASCENSION.

    As we present the information in this volume, the reader will be introduced to  the idea that the science of the ancients may have included a very  comprehensive knowledge of the deeper reality that present day sciences,  including physics, chemistry, mathematics, and astrophysics, are only  rediscovering.  And here we do not mean the ancient Egyptians or Babylonians or  Sumerians, but rather peoples of far greater antiquity than they, and that the  Egyptians, Babylonians, Sumerians, and so on, retained only a distorted and  corrupted version of these things in the form of myths and legends which they  elaborated and utilized in their "magical practices."  Further, we propose that  it is only in the light of the present day scientific knowledge that the true  ancient knowledge, depicted in these myths and legends and religious rites can  be properly understood.  Which is not to say that we are suggesting that we  understand or have interpreted all of them.  We are only saying that there are  many things in these ancient stories that suggest the former existence of an  advanced science, that may have enabled interface between layers, or dimensions  of reality on this planet in archaic times.

    This idea is not original to us, as many readers will know.  However, we do  think that we have been able to shine a light into certain dark corners that  have been, heretofore, poorly understood.  Arthur C. Clarke pointed out, "Any  sufficiently evolved technology is indistinguishable from magic."  

    When we divest our minds of preconceived notions about what the ancients may or  may not have known, and we just look at myths and legends, the substrate of  religions, over and over again we see descriptions of activities, events, terms  and potentials that express such things as a knowledge of free energy, anti- gravity, time travel, interplanetary travel, atomic energy, atomic  molecularization and demolecularization; just a whole host of doings that are  presently understood as the wild and superstitious imaginings of howling  savages.  Today, these concepts are only beginning to be understood.

      Many scholars explain that such stories - myths and legends - were primitive  attempts to understand the environment by personifying, or anthropomorphizing,  the forces of nature.  Other interpreters make the mistake of assuming that it  was a "sacred science" in terms that strictly deny any form of material  interpretation and interpenetration.

    I gave such ideas a great deal of thought at one point, all the while observing  my five children develop, and noting how they noticed things and what they  noticed, and how they explained it to themselves and each other.  One of the  earliest observations I made about children and their reactions to their  environment was that they pretty much just accept it as it is.  They don't seem  to need "explanations" for it.  What is "out there" is what it is until some  adult repeats to them some story about it which may entertain them or frighten  them.  Until "stories" are told to them, children are intensely busy just  imitating what they see other people do, most generally the adults in their  lives.  Without fantastic tales being told to them, their games of make-believe  consist of ordinary mundane and very HUMAN dramas.  And even when they are told  magical stories about flying horses or people with super powers, they often  resist these dramas in preference for those that directly apply to their own  experience and observation.

    Perhaps the comparison of the development of a child's thinking in relation to  their environment, to the development of evolutionary thinking of human beings  in general, is not altogether appropriate, but I do think that it ought to give  us some pause to question just where and how the creation of myth and legend  actually served human beings evolutionarily speaking.  Why would anyone tell a  story about a man with magic sandals that enabled him to fly if they are merely  anthropomorphizing the forces of nature?  If it is a "magical being" such as a  "god," why does he need sandals to fly with?  He could just as easily have  wings that are part of his physical structure.  He's already a god, after all.   He's not human.  So why the sandals?  

    Indeed, there may be an "archetypal pool of ideas" from which all humanity may  draw in dreams and visions, but that leads us into realms that of thought that  do not answer the simple question as to where and how and why howling savages  were served by making up fantastic tales about the forces of nature, that  included certain elements that suggest technology and not a truly "magical  state of being?"

    In the present day, there are all sorts of "mystical" groups and organizations  that claim to be the recipients of ancient knowledge, and that this matter has  to do with what is commonly called "occultism," or the "esoteric" or magical  practices.  There is a plethora of books that purport to be scientific, but  which totally reject mainstream science in any context.  Subjects such as  sacred geometry, archaeoastronomy, new physics, have all become subjects of  fevered study in order to discern the "occult significance" of the works of the  ancients.  And invariably, it is done in strictly ephemeral terms, positing  that all of the abilities of the ancients were accomplished strictly by magical  rites or rituals.  

    Occultists claim that the mental and spiritual powers of the ancients were what  we have lost.  They then assert that this ancient wisdom was broken up and  obscured in magical doctrines which those who are not "initiated" simply cannot  grasp.  They claim that parts of it have been handed down by continuous  tradition, and released to the world at opportune times, and other parts have  only been released to an elect few, of which exalted company, they, of course,  are obviously members.

    When considering such ideas, we do come to the thought that it is very likely  that there are rites or stories or myths behind the rituals, that may, indeed,  have been passed down in such secret groups in a more pure form than the  stories that make their way around the globe across millennia.  But that does  not mean that the "priesthood" of such groups truly understand the stories or  rites of which they are guardians - especially if they do not consider the  possibility that some of such information may be strictly and purely scientific  codes and require a trained scientist to decode them.

    Most of the so-called "occultists" and "sacred geometers" remind me of David  Macaulay's "Motel Of Mysteries,22   Boston, Houghton Mifflin, 1979"a humorous  account of an archaeological excavation of a twentieth century motel, in which  everything is meticulously excavated, recorded and then totally misinterpreted.   The "vast funerary" complex unearthed by Howard Carson contains wonders such  as the "Great Altar" (Television), a statueof the deity WATT (bedside lamp) and  the Internal Component Enclosure (or ICE box).  But just misunderstanding is  not all we have to contend with.  That  there are others who seem to be part of  the very Control System we have mentioned above with what seem to be extremely  dangerous proclivities of promulgating dangerous and cunning lies is also  evident as we will discuss further on.

    In terms of archaeology, there are processes involved in the formation of the  archaeological record.  A lack of understanding of these formation processes is  not always confined to the non-professionals.  It has only relatively recently  been suggested that the archaeology of a site is not a direct record of what  went on there, but instead may have been distorted by a whole series of  processes, including cataclysmic disruption.

    We are suggesting that the same may be true regarding myths and legends and  religious rites.  They are a sort of archaeological record of the history of  mankind held in archetypal terms, buried in stories, distorted by a whole  series of processes.

    Even if some of the purported ancient schools and mystical paths have kept some  of this information intact, or in a purer state, it still seems that much has  "faded on the page" due to the long period of time since such things were part  of the consensus - thus external - reality.  But still, there are those who  have seen the contradictions in our reality and our beliefs and who have sought  in these ancient teachings to discover what might have been known.  Many of  them have made discoveries that, when considered with information from many  other fields, assists us in this essential discovery of our true condition and  purpose.

    The question naturally arises, what does the history of the subject have to  tell us about what may or may not "really work?"  Can we examine it; can we  track it and discover not only the obstacles of the process, but also the REAL  BENEFITS that might accrue to the Seeker?  Can we track and discover the  apparent abilities that are the SIGNS of accomplishment of the successful  Quest?

    In short, what is the REAL Philosophers Stone?  What can the Hero really  accomplish when he finds the Holy Grail?

    One thing Mouravieff wrote that was powerfully meaningful to me was his series  of comments on the "type" of the Knight - who is already well-developed  emotionally, but really needs to work on the intellectual part.  The fact is  this: even though my husband and myself are considered to be "intellectuals"  and to have pursued intellectual development all our lives, what became  excruciatingly clear was that it was very one-sided in some respects.  Because  of what Mouravieff calls the "A" influences - and we just call it the Matrix  Control System - our EMOTIONS were distorted to only allow us to accept ideas  that were emotionally pleasing - even if they were of a high intellectual sort. 

     All of this has to do with what Mouravieff suggests is the "matter of  matters," i.e. "evil."  And that, of course, takes us to the many ideas of  "fixing" the world, or "saving" the world, or whatever.  In other words, what  amounts to hubris - deciding that the ideas that a person has about good and  evil based on human intellectualizations - must be enforced on creation.

    What I finally realized - in a period of intense initiation - was that God has  Many faces - not all of them pleasant to behold.  And, at that point, I SAW the  "Matrix," and I SAW the "A" influences and "B" influences, and that the REAL  work of this level of being is to CHOOSE one's alignment with one or the other,  and then to begin the process of discerning and "assimilating."  This is why  everything is "masked" in symbols.  This reality is, in a sense, the landscape  of the Quest for the Grail.   It is a TEST.  

    But more is needed, as Mouravieff points out.  One must, at some point, DO  something.  And this is where faith comes in.  It is not "faith" in the sense  of a "belief," but Faith in the REALITY of higher things... and it requires the  individual to essentially "step off a cliff" at the edge of the Matrix reality  into the reality of the REAL.  

    I did.

    And just as the alchemists describe it, such an act results in the "death" of  something - and the physical body - so attuned to the "A" influences - being  forcibly disconnected from them via WILL - goes through some of the most  horrible sufferings imaginable.  It could be said to be similar to drug  withdrawal in a sense, but a LOT worse.  In physical terms, an infection took  hold in my body affecting my eyes, ears, and lungs.  I literally wept blood.   For days I lay there, almost unable to breathe, with compresses on my eyes,  medications in my ears, ingesting the massive doses of the most powerful  antibiotics available that had no effect - and I did NOT relent.  I KNEW that  what I was experiencing was the efforts of the "agents of the Matrix" to turn  me aside from my resolve.  And I just kept affirming that "you can kill me if  you like, but I am NOT changing my course."

    And at some point, there was a "shift" and the forces withdrew.

    Ark "found me" 40 days later.  To the day.  

    Now, I have to tell you that this process of being brought to the point of  SEEING was facilitated in a gentle, but firm way by these "Cassiopaeans."  In  fact, looking back over my life in retrospect, I can perceive the influence  from the time of my birth - always there in the background watching over me,  waiting for me to "ask the question."  And when at last, in 1984, I was brought  to that point of bankruptcy - another period of serious illness - the  communication began in a direct way - I would ask the question mentally, and  just wait in a meditative state - and it would begin to flow as just "ideas"  which I would write down.  

    Well, because of the fact that my emotional nature has repeatedly led me into  traps - I already knew that my "machine tolerances" had to be analyzed and  adjusted.  I knew that I had to do research to ensure that what I was  "receiving" was not just more and better disinformation, so to say.

    And so, over the next ten years I did research... and it was during this  research that I came to the idea that, for me to be able to be objective about  things - more of the "adjustment of the machine" - the mode of transmission  really needed to be modified so that the thoughts bypassed my conscious mind.   And so, the two years of developing the circuit for the transmissions via the  board and planchette.  

    Yes, it is unusual.  But for me - knowing my own nature - that of  susceptibility to manipulation because the Love nature in me is so developed    and this energy was so  easily stolen, and manipulated by "agents" - it was a  necessary step.  

    Of course, meeting Ark was an event that was utterly stupendous.  It resulted  in all kinds of "effects" that I try to describe, but words fail.  Some of  these actually included bilocation.  

    Now, lest you think that is a little crazy, I want to point out that Ark is a  30 year career scientist.  At the time he "found me," having been on his own  quest for all his life as well, he had "put away" his dreams and was  functioning as the Director of the Department of Nonlinear Dynamics and Complex  Systems at the Institute for Theoretical Physics, University of Wroclaw,  Poland.  How he dealt with this "activation" of circuits and potentials that  had been suppressed for years is a story in itself.  Some of it is even rather  humorous now, when we look back.  Especially when a man who has convinced  himself that he is a "linear thinker" sees his "other half" come in a window  while she is physically 5,000 miles away.

    At that moment, I had fallen into a spontaneous "trance," so to say - something  that has almost never happened - and I was struggling to maintain my awareness.   I would force my eyes open to observe the environment, and what I saw was  LIVING LIGHT.  Meanwhile, some part of me had apparently decided to take a  little stroll across the Atlantic.

    This occurred several more times during this "readjustment of frequencies"  stage, and was always followed by a baffling period of intense cold where my  teeth would chatter and my body would ache just as if I were freezing.   Thankfully, I found an exact description of this process in the works of Ibn al- 'Arabi, which he calls a "descent."  Based on his description, it is a  temporary "seating" of the higher centers IN THE BODY for the purpose of  "bestowal" of qualities.  I sort of think of it as my higher self as the  "computer hardware repairman" who cam to make some serious adjustments in my  circuitry. Al-'Arabi points out that when the "angel," as he calls it,  withdraws, the individual, having been in a "state" of super-accelerated  vibration - which manifests as heat (and boy, was it HOT!) - then feels the  normal condition as intensely cold and cannot get warm by any human means and  must simply wait for the vibrations of the body to catch up with the vibrations  of the newly bestowed "station."  

    I was very relieved to read this.  And again, it was exactly right for me to  read it AFTER experiencing it so that I would not doubt my experience and think  that I had "manifested" it due to emotional thinking.

    This is also why it was exactly right, after going through the past year of  "trial by fire" that Mouravieff should become the new piece of the puzzle -  only AFTER the experiences he describes.  This is what convinces me of the fact  that he has brought to us a major piece of the puzzle.  There is NO possibility  that anything that has occurred in the past years was "suggested" to me by  reading his material beforehand, and the events are described by him in detail -  exactly as they happened.  In short, it further strengthens my HOPE that we  CAN "DO" something.  And I must say that, like you, I was losing my hope in the  course of the seemingly endless struggle.

    Because, of course, our struggle has been enormous, probably based on the fact  that we have "gone public" and have made some significant ripples in the  "Matrix."  And frankly, I do NOT think that anyone could do it without a  "living Tradition" such as the C's - because we always have guidance - even if  sometimes it is rather cryptic due to the non-violation of learning directive.   If not for their assurances that this relentless attack was the "fire" from  which would come "light," we would have just given up any public work at all.   The attacks, the liars and defamers, spreaders of "scandal" and odious and  sickening acts of purely filthy libel - attacks on our children even - were  utterly horrendous.  

    But we survived, we passed that test, daily turning the negative emotions into  "light" and giving it out to the world.  

    And Mouravieff was the "gift" that came after.

    And what a gift it is.

    >Any idea I 

    > had that nothing was true unless I could explain it has long ago been

    Oh, indeed.  But now, perhaps, you know better what we have done so far... you  start with faith that there IS Truth "out there."  You evaluate your own being  and determine how best to find out what is or is not truth - that's research -  after a period of that, which is the "collecting of "A" influences," as well as  a repeated series of shocks when you discover that what you may have believed  as true is NOT true... this begins to "fuse" the magnetic center.  

    After a period of that, once you get down to some of the most fundamental lies  in which you believed, and you are mightily shocked to have to make the choice  to give them up, or go back to sleep in the lies. 

     THEN you realize that Truth leads to action.  This action results in another  major shock - and that takes you over into a sort of "space" that is sort of an  "interval."  Hopefully, you have enough will to sustain yourself there... and  if so, you land on the next "note" which is essentially, a different "world."   And in THAT world, polar beings find each other.  And in that world, you find  hope.

    But again, hope is nurtured by knowledge - by research... and so, at this new  level of being, you continue...

Commentary on Boris Mouravieff's Gnosis

As things "heat up" here on the Big Blue Marble, we have received much correspondence from individuals asking "what to do." The subject has even come up a number of times in the egroup discussions, and many of the old fears and turmoil have surfaced with ideas of pulling up roots and - for reasons of self-preservation - moving here or there or undertaking to follow this or that promoter of "methods of ascension" or methods of "fixing the planet" so that everybody can just "get along" or we can all snuggle up with some warm fuzzies and get some rest.

The reader who has surveyed the material on this site has surely come to the conclusion that what we are saying is "nothing is as it seems and never has been," including the many religions and "methods of ascension" promoted down through the ages.

But what is lacking is a clearly defined WAY that might give guidance to the seeker in his quest for the keys to his own "salvation" in whatever terms he might define it. I have worked on presenting the WAY in both the Wave Series and the Adventures series by sharing my own experiences and what I have gleaned from much study and research, but some readers are put off by material that deals with all the lies and deceptions that we face in our reality and simply want to read something "uplifting." It doesn't seem to occur to them that one cannot be "uplifted" as long as one is mired in quicksand. What seems to be true is that we live in a world of lies - ruled by lies and stealing - and that human beings lie because it is impossible for them to do otherwise. Without a Way, that is.

As a result of our own searching and questing for answers, the repeated trying and testing of sources and materials, little by little we have come to the idea of what NOT to do. But again, there has not been a whole lot about what TO DO.

The Cassiopaeans have indicated certain pathways to follow, but as always, we are more or less on our own in acquiring the knowledge and learning how to apply it - and for good reason, as the reader may know.

In recent months however, we have been surveying a body of teachings that not only meshes with, but vigorously expands upon the Cassiopaean Transmissions to an extent that we cannot think that it is accidental. In fact, the overlapping and "filling in the gaps" quality of this work is so astounding that we are certain that the Cassiopaeans themselves are very likely involved in this teaching in ways we do not understand.

The work in question is that of the Russian exile Boris Mouravieff, presented in his three part study and commentaries entitled Gnosis. Very little information is available on the background of these materials while a good deal of disinformation is circulating in other circles, and it is best to address these problems before we even attempt to present the material.

As it happens, during our research into Boris M., we discovered that he was being soundly lambasted by William Patrick Patterson in his book "Talking With the Left Hand" in which he accuses Mouravieff of "stealing" his ideas from Gurdjieff. Patterson is the author of four highly praised books on spiritual development and is a longtime student of John Pentland, the man Gurdjieff chose to lead the Gurdjieff Work in America, and the editor of The Gurdjieff Journal©, the only international quarterly devoted to exploring the "ancient teaching of the Fourth way brought and embodied by G. I. Gurdjieff."

Just in case the reader is not familiar with Gurdjieff, let me give a little background. Dating from his first lectures in Moscow and St. Petersburg in 1912, George Ivanovich Gurdjieff attracted the attention of occultists and many Western aristocrats. His teachings (often referred to as the 'Gurdjieff Work' or 'Fourth Way') became widely known through the writings and lectures of his pupil, the famous Russian mathematician and journalist Pyotr D. Ouspensky, and were later propagated by Alfred Orage, John G. Bennett, Rodney Collins, and Dr. Maurice Nicoll.

Gurdjieff himself admitted that he was utilizing 'stolen' teachings from a wide range of groups that he had encountered (including the Yezidis, the Russian Orthodox Church, and Sufi 'Bektashi' and 'Naqshbandi' sects in the Hindu Kush and Pamir regions) in his world travels. A deep study of Gurdjieff's work shows that he was obviously experimenting with his own ideas on how to utilize bits and pieces from these different teachings to create a system that would enable individuals to overcome ingrained "cognitive defects," become more conscious, and awaken the Higher Self's "Objective Conscience."

At a certain point, it seems that Gurdjieff realized that he had undertaken an impossible task since nearly all of his students "heard" only what they wanted to hear. He closed his school and concentrated on putting his ideas into allegory in his book Beelzebub's Tales To His Grandson (1950), which also incorporated and developed additional esoteric themes into his ideas.

Many of Gurdjieff's concepts have profoundly influenced our present culture due to the fact that some of his followers were famous and wealthy and had the means to promote them to others in the upper classes. After his death in 1949, Gurdjieff's legacy was disseminated through many people, and much of his work has been passed on through fragmentation of the many groups into something akin to secular denominations. One of the biggest problems with what happened to Gurdjieff's work - what seemed to be a sincere attempt to help humanity - was further obscured by the formation of what can only be called personality cults and identifications with Gurdjieff at the expense of his ideas. It seems that Gurdjieff himself saw this coming at the end of his life.

Groups that are offshoots of Gurdjieff's teachings have been known to use all kinds of things to reprogram their members, including isolation, group think, authoritarian power structures, and other psychological methods designed to unmask or break down the personal ego. But, what seems clear is that, in the case of Gurdjieff, no one group can claim the whole cheese since he was curiously selective about what he told whom, and even those who were closest to him obviously misunderstood what he was trying to convey, as evidenced by his own statements about this factor towards the end of his life.

Mouravieff tells us:

    People interested in esoteric matters will probably have read the book by P.D. Ouspensky, published posthumously, titled "In Search of the Miraculous: Fragments of an Unknown Teaching."  The ideas in that book were presented to Ouspensky by Georges Gurdjieff.  Gurdjieff indicates the basis of his teaching: "for the benefit of those who know already, I will say that, if you like, this is esoteric Christianity."

    Ouspensky's book - correctly indicated by the title - contains only fragments of a tradition which, until recently, was only transmitted orally.  And only a study of the complete tradition can give access to the revelation.  The system disclosed by the fragments that form Ouspensky's book and Gurdjieff's work, originates from revelations issued by the Great Esoteric Brotherhood to which the Apostle Paul alluded in his Epistle to the Romans: 

        We are assured and know that all things work together and are fitting into a plan for good to and for those who love God and are called according to design and purpose.  For those whom He foreknew, He also destined from the beginning to be molded into the image of His Son, that he might become the firstborn of MANY brethren.  And those whom He thus foreordained, He also called; and those whom He called, He also justified, made them righteous, and those whom He justified, He also glorified.

        What then shall we say to this:  If God is for us, who can be against us? [8;28-31]

    Boris Mouravieff asks: What should be the attitude of students towards the "Gurdjieff phenomenon" and Ouspensky's "Fragments"?

    The attentive reader will easily find the answer to that question himself in the contents of this article: we must begin by separating the message from the messenger, and we must look for the message beyond the level or information. This is the way to discover and eliminate error.

    In a myth well known in the Orient we are told that there exists a race of 'Royal Swans'. The fable adds that if we put milk mixed with water in front of one of them, it will separate out the milk and drink it, leaving the water. That must be the attitude of students.

        "Saint Gregory Palamas said the same when he wrote in his first Triad: "As for those people they call ‘theologians’ or ‘teachers,’ and think themselves able to borrow their theological terms, is it necessary even to mention them? Is it necessary that we keep away from "the light which lights every man who comes into the world," and wait for the terrible shadows of ignorance to illumine us, on the pretext that, just as serpents are useful, this is something useful for us? For the flesh of serpents is only useful to us if they have been killed, and cut up and used with reason as a remedy against their own bites. Those who kill them in this way turn a part of these snakes against themselves, just as if they had killed with his own sword a new Goliath, who had taken arms, who had set himself up to oppose us, who cursed the army of the living God - someone educated in divine things by sinners and illiterates."

The fact is, Gurdjieff faced great difficulties at the point in time when he sought to experiment with waking up humanity. As noted above, it was "Mission Impossible." However, what he and his followers did manage to do was to slash a trail through a jungle of lies and disinformation. It is not appropriate for his followers to insist that this bare trail is all there is and that there is no more. Rather, it is only logical to widen the trail, to pass through the gate revealed at the end of the trail, and discover what lies on the other side.

    "Lastly," said Mouravieff, "let those who have profited and are still profiting from the 'message' be sincerely grateful to the messenger and to the one who interpreted it. If they know how, let them pray for the salvation of their souls."

Nevertheless, William Patrick Patterson has penned rather harsh and unseemly accusations against Mouravieff - rather similar to our own experiences with Maynerd Most and Alvin Wiley - that need to be addressed. As it happens, a student of Mouravieff has done precisely that in an article entitled A response to William Patrick Patterson's criticism in his book "Taking with the Left Hand" by a student of Boris Mouravieff, Translated from the French by Theodore J. Nottingham, from which the following is excerpted:

    Patterson fails to bring forth the least fact, the least witness, the least clue, the least element of proof. He only states an opinion, his own, considering it of sufficient weightiness to confuse it with the truth.

    When Patterson writes: "Mouravieff's negative judgment of Gurdjieff rests on...the perception...Gurdjieff stole the teaching", the statement suggests that this is Mouravieff's perception, a purely subjective assumption leading to a serious accusation: stealing.

    In fact, Mouravieff reports the admission from Gurdjieff himself. He brings a testimonial and it is the testimonial of an admission. The minimal space given to this fact can be compared to the long developments which Patterson devotes to his own assumptions. On one side an admission, on the other suppositions. To which does Patterson give more attention? [...]

    Patterson's attitude reveals a classic psychological process. We can see several aspects of this: The first aspect is evoked by Patterson himself: "the projection onto the teacher". Indeed, it seems that certain individuals cannot approach the Knowledge without associating a name or a face to it. They "personalize" that which, in essence, is beyond all personalizing; and then emotion surpasses thought, that is, intelligence. [...] They focus their attention on the messenger instead of the message. This personalizing can take the acute form of veneration, not to say idolatry. Then, all questioning of their idol, even in the name of truth, is judged iconoclastic. The "blasphemer" must be punished -- that is, invalidated -- so that the worship of the idol may continue.

    The second aspect: he who identifies with the messenger finds himself inevitably wounded by the "attacks" (as they see them) against the idol. His personality, cut to the quick, will react. Pushed on by Nature -- which refuses all suffering -- it will fall back on the "self-tranquilizing machine".

    We know that, among the means used by the self-tranquilizing machine, there are two primary ones: the first is sentimentality toward oneself, self-pity, the second is accusation of the other. Each of these attitudes -- or both together as they generally form an "infernal couple" -- will calm, place a balm on the wound. And this will occur to the detriment of truth, replaced by justifications and rationalizations calling upon imagination whenever necessary. [...]

    This approach is close to being in bad faith, for instance in suggesting that Gnosis is "verbiage and lack of clarity and comprehension on the part of Mouravieff". This is proven wrong by many readers who "have commented on the clarity of the text" (preface of Gnosis II).

I would like to add here that we most thoroughly agree that Mouravieff's work is extraordinary in its clarity and completion of what was started by Gurdjieff, explaining much that Gurdjieff never explained, or if he did, those he explained it to either did not understand it, or sought to keep it secret so as to dispense it in controlled dollops to those they considered worthy (or who had enough money to pay for it.) Mouravieff's student goes on to say:

    He writes (without any proof by the way): "Mouravieff, an exiled aristocrat, had the typical sense of superiority over Russian émigrés he presumed to be socially inferior." "An aristocrat, intellectual and moralist, Mouravieff no doubt had trouble with Gurdjieff's unconventional behavior." It seems that Patterson could not imagine any other criteria to perceive others than through their social circumstances, as if a person could be reduced to a caricature.

    Patterson criticizes Mouravieff for stripping "Gurdjieff's teaching of its mooring in sacred science and insert it into an Eastern Orthodox Christian perspective..." And he adds peremptorily: "The two teachings simply didn't fit together."

I would like to note here that the work of Mouravieff provides that ineluctable bridge between the works of Gurdjieff, Ibn al-'Arabi, Carlos Casteneda, conjectured esoteric Christianity, hermeticism/alchemy and the Cassiopaeans. It should be noted that the Cassiopaeans have definitively supported the existence and work of a man around whom the Jesus legend formed - though they tell us that the story in the Bible that is supposed to be history is a myth - and here we find a body of teachings that lends background to this view, as well as supplemental information that elucidates the many clues offered by the Cassiopaeans. In our opinion, it is not only precipitate to reject Mouravieff's work, it is possibly suicidal. The comments of Mouravieff's student continue:

    And yet...! Is not the System of Octaves symbolized by the musical scale (tones and semitones) as well as by the notes that compose it (Dominus, Sidereus orbis, etc...). Is not the origin of these notes a Christian hymn to John the Baptist? Mouravieff reminds us of this in detail (Gnosis, chapter 10). He therefore responds, in preventive measure, to the issues raised by Patterson by showing that Christianity, including its European version, contained the System of Octaves at a certain period.

    Going back through Christianity to Judaism, Mouravieff points out the presence of the System in David's Psalm 118. Finally, there is no question that the Philokalia contains all the precepts of the Work and its "Christianity" need not be proven...

    Besides, Gurdjieff himself -- as Mouravieff reminds us -- made reference rather often to both monasteries and to Christian esotericism. And, other than questioning Mouravieff's witness -- that is, to call him a liar -- Gurdjieff stated to him that [Gurdjieff's] System "was the ABC of Christian doctrine".

    Mouravieff himself tells us that he learned the System "in 1920-21" in Constantinople through Ouspensky and Gurdjieff. This does not mean that Mouravieff did not follow other teachings, "Christian" teachings for example (see references in the manuscript INITIATION). On this last point, having no information, we can only ask questions: Did Mouravieff have Christian masters? Did they know the System? Or did Mouravieff study for himself "monuments such as the Philokalia", and discovered on his own the keys to the Gospels from Psalm 118?

    It would be an exceptional exploit of a self-taught person in a field where everyone claims the importance of an oral tradition.

    In saying that Ouspensky had "never been initiated in the oral Tradition other than through Gurdjieff", Mouravieff suggests that he personally had access to this oral Tradition among confirmed masters. But this can only be a deduction, based on our crediting the honesty of Mouravieff; there is no "objective" certainty.

    Whatever the case may be, we come out of these conjectures with the observation, which is now entirely objective, that Gnosis contains more information then [Ouspensky's] Fragments. Mouravieff evaluated the volume of supplementary material in Gnosis at one third more than those contained in Ouspensky's Fragments.

    How can Patterson explain that the copier knows more than the one copied, that the thief is richer than the one who is robbed?

    Certainly, one should analyze the nature of this additional material contained in Gnosis. Are these traditional teachings or ideas belonging to Mouravieff? It is also possible that Ouspensky, or his inheritors, did not reveal everything in Fragments.

    But Patterson does not mention the objective fact that Gnosis completes Ouspensky's revelations. Ouspensky's fragmentary message becomes, thanks to Mouravieff, an enlarged message "in the strict limits which are necessary and sufficient to enable the student to go further and in depth through his own creative efforts."

    Gurdjieff never clearly announced his goal: "I certainly have a goal...but my goal cannot mean anything to you at this time." What Gurdjieff does not reveal, Patterson miraculously knows and can confide to us: "Gurdjieff's mission was to establish the ancient teaching of the Fourth Way in the West as quickly as possible."

    On the other hand, what Patterson does not tell us is by whom was this mission given and in what way Gurdjieff was predisposed to accomplish it. Mouravieff does present certain unfortunate predispositions [about Gurdjieff] which are not favorable to the accomplishment of Gurdjieff's supposed mission:

        1) Gurdjieff is more the "sorcerer" type (hypnotist) than the teacher in the tradition of Socrates. Considering his type, his teaching activity was in great risk of being contaminated and parasited by the hypnotic influence that he "automatically" exerted over people.

        2) According to Mouravieff, Gurdjieff did not possess the intellectual talent to structure and shape the teaching. He had to rely on an intermediary -- Ouspensky. Mouravieff also has reservations on the oral expression [of Gurdjieff] which was sometimes brutal and insulting.

    Why did Gurdjieff hide his sources? Why does he remain silent on this subject, except in rare exceptional circumstances, such as that encounter with Mouravieff at the Cafe de la Paix: "I find the system at the foundations of the Christian doctrine. What do you say on this matter?" [asked Mouravieff of Gurdjieff]-- "It is the ABC," Gurdjieff answered me. "But they do not understand this!"

    Gurdjieff's silence regarding his sources gives birth to a suspicion: he is silent for a reason, because he follows a purely personal goal. This is the very opposite to the accomplishment of a mission. Why would one who fulfills a mission hide his sources? [A response to William Patrick Patterson's criticism in his book "Taking with the Left Hand" by a student of Boris Mouravieff Translated from the French by Theodore J. Nottingham]

In his book, Struggle of the Magicians, Patterson includes quotes on the front pages which say:

    The Magus is the highest that man can approach to God. G.I. Gurdjieff

    Toast to Gurdjieff: God give you the strength and the manhood to endure your lofty solitude. Rachmilevitch

    Gurdjieff is a kind of walking God - a planetary or even solar God. A.R. Orage

In response to these ideas, obviously dear to the heart of many Gurdjieff followers, including Patterson, let me just point out that Gurdjieff never accomplished the transmutation. He died just like everybody else.

Considering the fact that several other "seekers" were reputed to have transitioned without seeing death - Flamel and Fulcanelli among them - we might think that the only parts of Gurdjieff's work that should interest us are the parts that elucidate the work of the affirmed Masters. And frankly, Mouravieff has offered many clues that do, in fact, contribute to the body of alchemical/hermetic knowledge in a significant way.

So, in reading these many sources and comparing, we do have some chance of discerning the gems caught between the cracks in the pavement. Patterson has done himself and all other seekers a great disservice in his attacks on Mouravieff.

One of the things that really struck me when doing the research on Mouravieff was the following remark from the pages of the group - Praxis - that is promoting his books:

    The course studies the Christian Gnosis of Boris Mouravieff, exiled at the time of the Russian Revolution, who was a little-known 'third man' who before and after WWII, and taught and practiced the Fourth Way in its original Christian form.

This raised the hair on my head not only because of all the material I had found in Mouravieff's work that echoed the words of the Cassiopaeans, but because of the remark they had once made:

    07-19-97
    A: Laura, my dear, if you really want to reveal "many beautiful and amazing things," all you need to do is remember the triad, the trilogy, the trinity, and look always for the triplicative connecting clue profile. Connect the threes... do not rest until you have found three beautifully balancing meanings!!
    Q: So, in everything there are three aspects?
    A: And why? Because it is the realm of the three that you occupy. In order to possess the keys to the next level, just master the Third Man Theme, then move on with grace and anticipation.

And I can guarantee the reader that Mouravieff presents the keys to move on to the next level.

This brings us back to the issue of what we are supposed to DO in this day and age that is getting scarier by the minute. When I was at that stage myself, asking where should we do and what should we do, I was quite surprised when the C's responded that all of the running around to look for "safe places" was just "3D thinking" and that the only thing that counted was:

    "Who you are and WHAT YOU SEE."

This was expanded with a question about what are the lessons of 3D that we need to learn to "graduate" to 4 D:

    Q: (L) Well, how in the heck am I supposed to get there [graduate to 4th Density] if I can't "get it?"
    A: Who says you have to "get it" before you get there?
    Q: (L) Well, that leads back to: what is the wave going to do to expand this awareness? Because, if the wave is what "gets you there," what makes this so?
    A: No. It is like this: After you have completed all your lessons in "third grade," where do you go?
    Q: (L) So, it is a question of...
    A: Answer, please.
    Q: (L) You go to fourth grade.
    A: Okay, now, do you have to already be in 4th grade in order to be allowed to go there? Answer.
    Q: (L) No. But you have to know all the 3rd density things...
    A: Yes. More apropos: you have to have learned all of the lessons.
    Q: (L) What kind of lessons are we talking about here?
    A: Karmic and simple understandings.
    Q: (L) What are the key elements of these understandings, and are they fairly universal?
    A: They are universal.
    Q: (L) What are they?
    A: We cannot tell you that.
    Q: (L) Do they have to do with discovering the MEANINGS of the symbology of 3rd density existence, seeing behind the veil... and reacting to things according to choice? Giving each thing or person or event its due? [As the Sufis teach.]
    A: Okay. But you cannot force the issue. When you have learned, you have learned!

Curiously, this issue of what the individual can SEE was brought up in another context - that of discerning the character of very negative forces in our reality:

    Q: (L) Okay. Bundy described his murdering urges as a "pressure building inside" him that he couldn't overcome, and it seemed to cause him to stop being "human," as we think of it. That seems to me to be an example of an implant being able to overcome a person's social behavior, or controls over antisocial tendencies. Is this also what happened to the person who killed JO?
    A: Maybe.
    Q: (L) Is there a connection between the newly missing girl, CB, and JO?
    A: You are doing well in your probing of the knowledge within on this issue, we suggest continuance, after all, learning is fun!
    Q: (L) So, it seems to me that there was a connection between the appearance of CB and JO. Could it be that the individual who killed one or both of them was programmed to respond to this particular type facial characteristic? Could that be part of the programming?
    A: End subject.
    Q: (L) What do you mean?
    A: We have helped you all that is necessary for now on this matter. It is beneficial for you to continue on your own for growth.
    Q: (L) Can I ask just one or two more LITTLE questions in a different direction? I mean, this is like walking away and leaving me in the dark!
    A: No it is not!
    Q: (L) I would like to be able to solve this because the families are in pain and have asked for help.
    A: Why don't you trust your incredible abilities? If we answer for you now, you will be helpless when it becomes necessary for you to perform this function on a regular basis, as it will be!!!!
    Q: (L) Well, frankly, I don't want to be involved in any more murder investigations. It is too upsetting. Am I supposed to DO this sort of thing regularly???
    A: Not same arena.
    Q: (L) Well, then how do you mean "perform this function?"
    A: No, seeing the unseen.

I would like to ask the reader to please note that the C's indicated that "seeing the unseen" would be a necessary function and that being unable to do it would leave me (and anybody else on the path!) "helpless." This takes us back to "who you are and what you SEE," and leads to another important point:

    C's: Beware of disinformation. It diverts your attention away from reality thus leaving you open to capture and conquest and even possible destruction. Disinformation comes from seemingly reliable sources. It is extremely important for you to not gather false knowledge as it is more damaging than no knowledge at all. Remember knowledge protects, ignorance endangers. The information you speak of, Terry, was given to you deliberately because you and Jan and others have been targeted due to your intense interest in level of density 4 through 7 subject matter. You have already been documented as a "threat." [...] Remember, disinformation is very effective when delivered by highly trained sources because hypnotic and transdimensional techniques are used thereby causing electronic anomalies to follow suggestion causing perceived confirmation to occur.

So, let's get on with it: learning to See the Unseen with the help of the work of Mouravieff.

In the following sections, I will be quoting heavily from Mouravieff's books, including the introductions, but often with the insertion of "modern terms" at certain points, or terms which will make the excerpts more comprehensible to those who have not delved deeply into such studies. It is my hope that this condensation will inspire the readers to not only read the works of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky and Mouravieff, but that it will provide a broader framework for understanding the many articles and sessions files of Cassiopaean Transmissions published on this website.

    Boris Mouravieff's trilogy "Gnosis," is an attempt to recover and describe, in terms understandable to modern man, a particular Tradition handed down over the centuries, in a sometimes broken line, but one that still exists today in the Eastern Orthodox Church.  This tradition could be said to be the Christian equivalent of Yoga, Zen, and the other inner traditions of the far Eastern religions, disciplines, which have each existed as specializations within the religion of which they are a part.

    It is not one man's system or invention, but has its roots far back in the history of Christianity - whose roots lie in certain statements of St. Paul, and perhaps even of Christ himself.  Their development can be traced first through formative figures of the early churches, and it clearly relates to the doctrines expressed in the key texts of Eastern spirituality such as the Philokalia.

    It clearly relates the oral tradition known as the Royal Way that survives to this day in the main centers of monasticism in the Eastern church.  But it does not claim to be a work of Orthodox theology, nor to reinterpret Orthodox doctrine.

    Mouravieff admits that the survival of this tradition within the church is tenuous, that the doctrine does not appear to survive in full or has not been collected together in full.  Monks on Athos admit the existence of the Tradition but say that it has never been fully spelled out in writing.  The importance of Mouravieff's work is the effort he has made to collect that dispersed information and to make it accessible in practical form.

    What are the sources of Mouravieff's knowledge?  It is clear that his text consists of knowledge of a high order.

    There are several ways in which the accuracy of a text can be verified, and Mouravieff's stands up to all these methods of assay.  First of all, it fits the Orthodox tradition as expressed by those who still possess the Royal Way.  It evokes the confirmation of inspiration described in Plato's seventh letter.  It predicts, in what appears at first to be mere theory, the actual events of the life in the study of Gnosis.  It stands the test of practice, and in doing so it remains internally consistent.  When it does introduce ideas from other traditions, such as the concept of karma, it does so in ways that, properly understood, remain consistent to the overall statement of the doctrine with a degree of precision equal to that of the mature external sciences.

    Those who can discriminate between different levels of knowledge will find in Mouravieff and almost inexhaustible treasury of knowledge that can lead to true spiritual transformation.  But it is necessary first to work for this discrimination.  Without it, not only will you be unable to differentiate between gnosis and its imitations, but even Mouravieff's work will not release its gnosis to you in trust.

    The idea of esotericism is often misunderstood.  The clue can be found in the Gospel of Saint John:  "I am the vine, ye are the branches: he that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing."

    The word translated "without," the Greek "choris," quite definitely means "outside."  What this means is that in those times there was an inner knowledge, based on assenting to traditional knowledge - gnosis - which is then confirmed experimentally through techniques of inner observation, and a purely external kind of knowledge, gained through the ordinary senses.

    Constantine Cavarnos confirmed that there is an exoteric and esoteric Christianity:

    "The first kind of philosophy, external philosophy, comprises for them ancient Greek philosophy and the pagan philosophy of early Christian centuries.  The second kind, "internal philosophy," is identical with the [true] Christian religion." [The Hellenic Christian Philosophical Tradition," Institute for Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies, Belmont, MA, 1989. p. 109, quoted in the introduction to Mouravieff's "Gnosis II]

    Over the years, this esotericism has formed a Tradition, a science, or discipline of knowledge which may have existed before the time of Christ, but which has since been totally assimilated to the inner meaning of Christianity.  Boris Mouravieff says that "This Tradition, which in Antiquity was only revealed in the Mysteries under the seal of absolute secrecy." 

Under the influence of self-proclaimed initiates of The Tradition such as Guenon and Schwaller, Mouravieff has unfortunately adopted the idea that this Tradition passed from Egypt to Judaea and thus to Christianity. However what is clear is that the True Tradition of the Eleusinian mysteries is behind Christianity, and it was the Egyptian Tradition that became the false teaching that corrupted and distorted the work of the man we have come to know as Jesus. It is only in more recent times, with much additional research, including that of Pincknett and Prince in The Stargate Conspiracy, that we are even able to separate these threads and come to this understanding. So, Mouravieff cannot be criticized on this score.

In Manly Hall's exhaustive compendium, The Secret Teachings of All Ages, we find mention of the fact that St. Irenaeus was complaining about the efforts to compare Christianity to the religion of the Egyptians which included the death and resurrection of Osiris/Horus.  Irenaeus had some other interesting things to say about this, as Hall points out:

    "According to popular conception, Jesus was crucified during the thirty-third year of His life and in the third year of His ministry following his baptism. About AD 180, St. Irenaeus, Bishop of Lyons, one of the most eminent of the ante-Nicene theologians, wrote Against Heresies, an attack on the doctrines of the Gnostics. In this work, Irenaeus declared upon the authority of the Apostles themselves that Jesus lived to old age. To quote:

        'They, however, that they may establish their false opinion regarding that which is written, maintain that He preached for one year only, and then suffered in the twelfth month. [In speaking thus], they are forgetful of their own disadvantage, destroying His whole work, and robbing Him of that age which is both more necessary and more honourable than any other, that more advanced age, I mean, during which also as a teacher He excelled all others. For how could He have had His disciples, if He did not teach? And how could He have taught unless He had reached the age of a Master?

        For when He came to be baptised, He had not yet completed His thirtieth year, but was beginning to be about thirty years of age; and, according to these men, He preached only one year reckoning from His baptism. On completing His thirtieth year He suffered, being in fact still a young man, and who had by no means attained to advanced age.

        Now, that the first stage of early life embraces thirty years, and that this extends onward to the fortieth year, every one will admit; but from the fortieth and fiftieth year a man begins to decline towards old age, which Our Lord possessed while He still fulfilled the office of a Teacher, even as the Gospel and all the elders testify; those who were conversant in Asia with John, the disciple of the Lord, affirming that John conveyed to them that information. And He remained among them up to the time of Trajan.

        Some of them, moreover, saw not only John, but the other apostles also, and heard the very same account from them, and bear testimony as to the validity of the statement. Whom then should we rather believe? Whether such men as these or Ptolemaeus, who never saw the apostles, and who never even in his dreams attained to the slightest trace of an apostle?"

Well, obviously, this "Gospel" that Irenaeus refers to as testifying that Jesus did not suffer and die has disappeared! It could be among those of the library of Nag Hammadi. But, commenting on the foregoing passage, theologian Godfrey Higgins remarks that it has fortunately escaped the hands of those destroyers who have attempted to render the Gospel narratives consistent by deleting all such statements. He also notes that the doctrine of the crucifixion was a vexata questio among Christians even during the second century.

    "The evidence of Irenaeus, " he says, "cannot be touched. On every principle of sound criticism, and of the doctrine of probabilities, it is unimpeachable." [Anacalypsis, Godfrey Higgins, London, 1836, quoted by Manly P. Hall]

The fad for all things "Egyptian" has been with us for a very long time.  Schwaller de Lubicz - the vector of many of these ideas - settled in Egypt in 1938 and for the next 15 years studied the symbolism of the temples, particularly Luxor, finding what he considered to be proof that the ancient Egyptians were the ultimate examples of Synarchy, because the were ruled by a group of elite initiates.  He failed to point out that the Egyptian civilization was static and limited.  What's more, it caved in on itself, and never managed to produce any significant work of benefit for humanity, as Otto Neugebauer showed conclusively in his "The Exact Sciences in Antiquity."

The open-minded thinker ought to really consider the purported mysteries of Egypt in terms of the fact that they were so ignorant that they devoted a huge amount of energy to their "cult of the dead."  The whole Egyptian shtick is focused around preserving dead flesh for future or otherworldly reanimation.  The very fact that there are so many of these dead bodies for Egyptologists to dig up is the clearest evidence that the Egyptian beliefs were nonsense.

The whole issue of the excitement over Egyptian civilization is the belief that they had some power to control the forces of life because they built the pyramids and we can't.  And has it never occurred to anybody that the existence of the pyramids in conjunction with the worship of an elite group of human beings, while everybody else was wearing loincloths and sweating in the hot sun, might suggest a relationship between the two?  The fact is, the Egyptian civilization seems to have been the chief example of a vast chasm between the haves and the have-nots, and they managed to do it longer than anybody else.

In examining the work of Schwaller, we have one of the better examples of the subtle way the negative occult societies attack those who come to bring light, by association and co-opting.  The tactic is to find a means of subtly allying their message with that of the truly Positive so as to generate confusion in untrained minds which would tend on surface evidence to accept these actually contrary messages as similar, at least in intent.

The negative occultists who are promoting the new Control System borrow all their components from what is of truth, and proceed by the method of imitation.  They literally will ape the expression of positive teachings, and all the more carefully when they wish to be mistaken altogether for purveyors of truth, so as to subvert the messages.

Their usual strategy is to begin by adhering so closely to the truth as to be virtually indistinguishable to all but heightened, thinking awareness.  They install their ideas through the rhythmic lull of entrainment so as to catch the "congregation" totally off guard when they finally diverge slightly or greatly from the truth and so pull the listener along with them.  The voice of deception is, of course, all the more ingratiatingly imitative of "goodness" where it is addressing a listener who is truly desirous of seeking truth; those who are lazy to begin with don't need such careful wording to deceive them as they are already willing to be deceived.

And so it was that Mouravieff, under the influence of the Synarchists of his day, introduced some of their ideas into his own synthesis of the authentic Tradition, including the idea that the Tradition was passed from Egypt to Judaea via Moses.

What seems to be the Truth is that the Tradition came from the North, the fabled land of the Hyperboreans, via Orpheus and Pythagoras.

Accounts of the travels and studies of Pythagoras differ, but most historians agree that he visited many countries and studied at the feet of many masters. Supposedly, after having been initiated into the Eleusinian mysteries, he went to Egypt and was initiated into the Mysteries of Isis. He then traveled to Phoenicia and Syria and was initiated into the Mysteries of Adonis. After that, he traveled to the valley of the Euphrates and learned all the secrets of the Chaldeans still living in the area of Babylon. Finally, he traveled to Media and Persia, then to India where he was a pupil and initiate of the Brahmins there. Sounds like he had all the bases covered.

Pythagoras was said to have invented the term "philosopher" in preference to the word "sage" since the former meant one who is attempting to find the truth, and the latter means one who knows the truth. Apparently Pythagoras didn't think he had the whole banana.

Pythagoras started a school at Crotona in Southern Italy and gathered students and disciples there whom he supposedly instructed in the principles of the secrets that had been revealed to him. He considered mathematics, music and astronomy to be the foundation of all the arts and sciences. When he was about sixty years old, he married one of his disciples and had seven children. I guess he was a pretty lively senior citizen! His wife was, apparently, quite a woman in her own right and she carried on his work after he was assassinated by a band of murderers incited to violence by a student whom he refused to initiate. The accounts of Pythagoras' murder vary. Some say he and all his disciples were killed, others say that he may have escaped because some of his students protected him by sacrificing themselves and that he later died of a broken heart when he realized the apparent fruitlessness of his efforts to illuminate humanity.

The experts say that very little remains of the teachings of Pythagoras in the present time unless it has been handed down in secret schools or societies. And, naturally, every secret society on the planet claims to have this "initiated" knowledge to one extent or another. It is possible that there exists some of the original secret numerical formulas of Pythagoras, but the sad fact is that there is no real evidence of it in the writings that have issued from these groups for the past millennium. Though everyone discusses Pythagoras, no one seems to know any more than the post-Pythagorean Greek speculators who "talked much, wrote little, knew less, and concealed their ignorance under a series of mysterious hints and promises." There seems to be a lot of that going around these days! Even Plutarch did not pretend to be able to explain the significance of the geometrical diagrams of Pythagoras. However, he did make the most interesting suggestion that the relationship which Pythagoras established between the geometrical solids and the gods was the result of images seen in the Egyptian temples. And that, of course, could be misleading.

Albert Pike, the great Masonic symbolist, also admitted that there were many things that he couldn't figure out. In his Symbolism for the 32nd and 33rd degrees he wrote:

    I do not understand why the 7 should be called Minerva, or the cube, Neptune. ...Undoubtedly the names given by the Pythagoreans to the different numbers were themselves enigmatical and symbolic - and there is little doubt that in the time of Plutarch the meanings these names concealed were lost. Pythagoras had succeeded too well in concealing his symbols with a veil that was from the first impenetrable, without his oral explanation.

Manly Hall writes:

    This uncertainty shared by all true students of the subject proves conclusively that it is unwise to make definite statements founded on the indefinite and fragmentary information available concerning the Pythagorean system of mathematical philosophy.

With what little we have examined thus far, we are beginning to realize how true this latter remark is. Of course, in the present time, there is a whole raft of folks who don't let such remarks stop them. Any number of modern gurus claim to have discovered the secrets of "Sacred Geometry!" Not only that, they don't seem to have even studied the matter deeply at all, missing many of the salient points that are evident in the fragments of Pythagorean teachings. Regarding this, there is a passage in Foucault's Pendulum, by Umberto Eco, that explicates the problem:

    Amid all the nonsense there are some unimpeachable truths... I invite you to go and measure [an arbitrarily selected] kiosk. You will see that the length of the counter is one hundred and forty-nine centimeters - in other words, one hundred-billionth of the distance between the earth and the sun. The height at the rear, one hundred and seventy-six centimeters, divided by the width of the window, fifty-six centimeters, is 3.14. The height at the front is nineteen decimeters, equal, in other words, to the number of years of the Greek lunar cycle. The sum of the heights of the two front corners is one hundred and ninety times two plus one hundred and seventy-six times two, which equals seven hundred and thirty-two, the date of the victory at Poitiers. The thickness of the counter is 3.10 centimeters, and the width of the cornice of the window is 8.8 centimeters. Replacing the numbers before the decimals by the corresponding letters of the alphabet, we obtain C for ten and H for eight, or C10H8, which is the formula for naphthalene.

    ...With numbers you can do anything you like. Suppose I have the sacred number 9 and I want to get the number 1314, date of the execution of Jacques de Molay - a date dear to anyone who professes devotion to the Templar tradition of knighthood. ...Multiply nine by one hundred and forty-six, the fateful day of the destruction of Carthage. How did I arrive at this? I divided thirteen hundred and fourteen by two, by three, et cetera, until I found a satisfying date. I could also have divided thirteen hundred and fourteen by 6.28, the double of 3.14, and I would have got two hundred and nine. That is the year Attalus I, king of Pergamon, ascended the throne.

    You see? ...The universe is a great symphony of numerical correspondences... numbers and their symbolisms provide a path to special knowledge. But if the world, below and above, is a system of correspondences where tout se tient, it's natural for the [lottery] kiosk and the pyramid, both works of man, to reproduce in their structure, unconsciously, the harmonies of the cosmos. [Eco]

The idea has been promoted with great vigor for over a thousand years that so-called Kabbalists and "interpreters of mysteries" can discover with their incredibly tortuous methods The Truth, completely misses the point of a truth that is far more ancient: Mathematics is the language of Nature. The Pythagoreans declared arithmetic to be the mother of the mathematical sciences. This idea was based on the fact that geometry, music, and astronomy are dependent upon arithmetic, but arithmetic is not dependent upon them. In this sense, geometry may be removed but arithmetic will remain; but if arithmetic be removed, geometry will be eliminated. In the same way, music depends on arithmetic. Eliminating music affects arithmetic only by limiting one of its expressions.

Why do we think that Esoteric Christianity is related to the ancient Eleusinian mysteries?

The cult of Demeter which celebrated the Eleusinian rites was well established in Mycenaea in the 13th century BC, and it is more than likely that the Feast of Tabernacles in Canaan was an offshoot of this activity. Our sources of information regarding the Eleusinian Mysteries include the ruins of the sanctuary there; numerous statues, bas reliefs, and pottery. We also have reports from ancient writers such as Aeschylos, Sophocles, Herodotus, Aristophanes, Plutarch, and Pausanias - all of whom were initiates - as well as the accounts of Christian commentators like Clement of Alexandria, Hippolytus, Tertullian, and Astorias, who were critics and not initiates. Yet for all this evidence, the true nature of the Mysteries remains shrouded in uncertainty because the participants were remarkably steadfast in honoring their pledge not to reveal what took place in the Telesterion, or inner sanctum of the Temple of Demeter. To violate that oath of secrecy was a capital offense. For these reasons,scholars today must make use of circumstantial evidence and inferences, with the result that there is still no consensus as to what did or did not take place.

Many experts have concluded - probably erroneously - that the Mysteries at Eleusis originally must have come from Egypt. The fact is, the sanctuary ruins in Eleusis evidently go back centuries earlier than the Egyptian Hymn to Demeter recited by Homer that is often cited as the proof that the origin was Egyptian. What is more, the excavations have unearthed no Egyptian artifacts there from that period.

Many scholars today favor the view that the cult of Demeter probably derived from Thessaly or Thrace. They base this conclusion partly on references in Homer and other ancient authors to some evidently pre-Dorian temples to Demeter in the Thessalian towns of Thermopylae, Pyrasos, and Pherai; partly on certain etymological links connecting key words in the rites of Demeter to pre-Hellenic dialects from the north . Other scholars point out that Demeter may be the same as a goddess "Dameter," who is mentioned briefly in Linear B tablets from Pylos dating from approximately 1200 BC. This evidence suggests that the cult of Demeter may after all have originated in the southern Peleponnesus.

In any case, whether the specific cult of Demeter at Eleusis originated in northern or southern Greece, the undeniable parallels with worship of grain goddesses in other parts of the eastern Mediterranean region point to frequent contacts and the cross-fertilization of religious ideas. And we certainly think that the Canaanite Feast of Tabernacles was a corrupted version of some more ancient form.

As it happens, the term "Thesmophoria" is derived from thesmoi, meaning "laws," and phoria, "carrying," in reference to the goddess as "law-bearer." But the symbolism of the ark as the "law bearer" in the "tent of meeting," or the "Mother-Delta," the "doorway to the higher realms," replaced the original meaning and the role of women in the process. Based on our own researches, we believe that True Christianity - which is almost virtually unknown today - was a resurgence of a very ancient Tradition - and that this same Tradition was preserved, in part, in Shamanic lore, was part of the Cathar beliefs as well as the true meaning of the Grail legends.

Jessie L. Weston writes in From Ritual to Romance:

    The more closely one studies pre-Christian Theology, the more strongly one is impressed with the deeply and daringly spiritual character of its speculations, and the more doubtful it appears that such teaching can depend upon the unaided processes of human thought, or can have been evolved from such germs as we find among the supposedly 'primitive' peoples... Are they really primitive? Or are we dealing, not with the primary elements of religion, but with the disjecta membra of a vanished civilization?

    Certain it is that so far as historical evidence goes our earliest records point to the recognition of a spiritual, not of a material, origin of the human race. Students of the Grail literature cannot fail to have been impressed by a certain atmosphere of awe and mystery which surrounds that enigmatic Vessel. There is a secret connected with it, the revelation of which will entail dire misfortune on the betrayer. [...] It is so secret a thing that no woman, be she wife or maid, may venture to speak of it. [...]

    There is no doubt that the Grail was something secret, mysterious and awful, the exact knowledge of which was reserved to a select few. […] The Nature Cults still remain reliable guides; it is their inner, their esoteric, ritual which will enable us to bridge the gulf between what appears at first sight the wholly irreconcilable elements of Folk-tale and high Spiritual mystery."

In our work on Noah, we have tracked the Grail legends back to prehistoric times - in Western Europe and Central Asia - via the very area emphasized in many other ancient myths, including that of Jason and the Argonauts: Colchis and the Caucasus regions. Mircea Eliade writes:

    Recent researches have clearly brought out the "shamanic" elements in the religion of the paleolithic hunters. Horst Kierchner has interpreted the celebrated relief at Lascaux as a representation of a shamanic trance. The same author considers that the "kommandostabe" - mysterious objects found in prehistoric sites - are drumsticks. If this interpretation is accepted, the prehistoric sorcerers would already have used drums comparable to those of the Siberian shamans.

    Finally, Karl J. Narr has reconsidered the problem of the "origin" and chronology of shamanism in his important study. He brings out the influence of notions of fertility (Venus statuettes) on the religious beliefs of the prehistoric North Asian hunters; but this influence did not disrupt the paleolithic tradition. His conclusions are as follows: Animal skulls and bones found in the sites of the European Paleolithic (before 50,000 - ca. 30,000 BC) can be interpreted as ritual offerings. [...] Soon afterward, probably about 25,000 BC, Europe offers evidence for the earliest forms of shamanism (Lascaux) with the plastic representations of the bird, the tutelary spirit, and ecstasy. [...]

    What appears to be certain is the antiquity of "shamanic" rituals and symbols. It remains to be determined whether these documents brought to light by prehistoric discoveries represent the first expressions of a shamanism in statu nascendi or are merely the earliest documents today available for an earlier religious complex, which, however, did not find "plastic" manifestations (drawings, ritual objects, etc) before the period of Lascaux.[…]

    Everywhere in those lands, [ in Central and North Asia,] and from the earliest times, we find documents for the existence of a Supreme Being of celestial structure, who also corresponds morphologically to all the other Supreme Beings of the archaic religions. The symbolism of ascent, with all the rites and myths dependent on it, must be connected with celestial Supreme Beings; we know that "height" was sacred as such, that many supreme gods of archaic peoples are called "He on high," or "he of the Sky," or simply "Sky." This symbolism of ascent and "height" retains its value even after the "withdrawal" of the celestial Supreme Being - for, as is well known, Supreme Beings gradually lose their active place in the cult, giving way to religious forms that are more "dynamic" and "familiar" (the gods of storm and fertility, demiurges, the souls of the dead, the Great Goddesses, etc.) […]

    The reduction or even the total loss in religious currency of uranian Supreme Beings is sometimes indicated in myths concerning a primordial and paradisal time when communications between heaven and earth were easy and accessible to everyone; as the result of some happening, these communications were broken off and the Supreme Beings withdrew to the highest sky.[…    insert Saturn theory how it withdrew

The disappearance of the cult of the celestial Supreme Being did not nullify the symbolism of ascent with all its implication. […] The shamanic ecstasy could be considered a reactualization of the mythical illud tempus when men could communicate in concreto with the sky. It is indubitable that the celestial ascent of the shaman is a survival, profoundly modified and sometimes degenerate, of this archaic religious ideology centered on faith in a celestial Supreme Being and belief in concrete communications between heaven and earth. […] The myths refer to more intimate relations between the Supreme Beings and shamans; in particular, they tell of a First Shaman, sent to earth by the Supreme Being or his surrogate to defend human beings against diseases and evil spirits.

    This historical change in the religions of Central and North Asia […] in turn altered the meaning of the shaman's ecstatic experience. Descents to the underworld, the struggle against evil spirits, the increasingly familiar relations with "spirits" that result in their "embodiment" or in the shaman's being "possessed" by "spirits," are innovations, most of them recent. In addition, there are the influences from the south, which appeared quite early and which altered both cosmology and the mythology and techniques of ecstasy. Among these southern influences we must reckon, in later times, the contribution of Buddhism and Lamaism, added to the Iranian and, in the last analysis, Mesopotamian influences that preceded them.

    The initiatory schema of the shaman's ritual death and resurrection is likewise an innovation, but one that goes back to much earlier times; in any case, it cannot be ascribed to influences from the ancient Near East. But the innovations introduced by the ancestor cult particularly affected the structure of this initatory schema. The very concept of mystical death was altered by the many and various religious changes effected by lunar mythologies, the cult of the dead, and the elaboration of magical ideologies.[including Egyptian]

    Hence we must conceive of Asiatic shamanism as an archaic technique of ecstasy whose original underlying ideology - belief in a celestial Supreme Being with whom it was possible to have direct relations by ascending into the sky - was constantly being transformed by a ongoing series of exotic contributions culminating in the invasion of Buddhism.

    The concept of mystical death, furthermore, encouraged increasingly regular relations with the ancestral souls and the "spirits," relations that ended in "possession." The phenomenology of the trance underwent many changes and corruptions, due in large part to confusion as to the precise nature of ecstasy. Yet all these innovations and corruptions did not succeed in eliminating the possibility of the true shamanic ecstasy.

    More than once we have discerned in the shamanic experience a "nostalgia for paradise" that suggests one of the oldest types of Christian mystical experience. As for the "inner light," which plays a part of the first importance in Indian mysticism and metaphysics as well as in Christian mystical theology, it is already documented in shamanism.

    But shamanism is important not only for the place that it holds in the history of mysticism. The shamans have played an essential role in the defense of the psychic integrity of the community They are preeminently the antidemonic champions; they combat not only demons and disease, but also the black magicians. [A shaman is a] tireless slayer of demons. The military elements that are of great importance in certain types of Asian shamanism (lance, cuirass, bow, sword, etc.) are accounted for by the requirements of war against the demons, the true enemies of humanity. In a way it can be said that shamanism defends life, health, fertility, the world of "light," against death, diseases, sterility, disaster, and the world of "darkness."[...]

    What is fundamental and universal is the shaman's struggle against what we could call "the powers of evil." […] The shaman's essential role in the defense of the psychic integrity of the community depends above all on this: men are sure that one of them is able to help them in the critical circumstances produced by the inhabitants of the invisible world. […] A member of the community is able to see what is hidden and invisible to the rest and to bring back direct and reliable information from the supernatural worlds.[…]

    We have already referred to the likenesses between the accounts of shamanic ecstasies and certain epic themes in oral literature. The shaman's adventures in the other world, the ordeals that he undergoes in his ecstatic descents below and ascents to the sky, suggest the adventures of the figures in popular tales and the heroes of epic literature. Probably a large number of epic "subjects" or motifs, as well as many characters, images, and cliches of epic literature, are, finally, of ecstatic origin, in the sense that they were borrowed from the narrative of shamans describing their journeys and adventures in the superhuman worlds. [ Eliade, Mircea, Shamanism, Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy.]

In short, we suggest that Esoteric Christianity - the REAL teachings of Jesus - were a revival of the most ancient of True Traditions of Freedom - an antediluvian tradition handed down from the Ancient Athenians of Plato's myth - the defenders of the world against the Evil Empire of Atlantis. This Evil Empire of Atlantis is reincarnated in the present day - the controlling empire of our world - and seeks to establish a One World control system exactly as Atlantis did ages ago. Part of the means of doing this includes brainwashing the masses, even those who are seeking alternative explanations in philosophy and religion. For those who seek outside the already corrupted standard religions, there is now the Stargate Conspiracy - the promotion of Egyptian and South American mysticism as the source of the Tradition. And it is a lie.

Christianity is quite interesting when one removes the obvious gloss of the Egyptian resurrection myth. When the reader is fully informed about the variations on these two themes, it is almost pathetically easy to read the New Testament and see what might be original to "Jesus," and what was added by the "creators" of Christianity as we know it.

What is even more interesting was the fact that the only writings contemporary to the times of early Christianity, which mention it specifically, remark that it is a "vile superstition." Yet, what we have as Christianity today, is nothing more or less than the same religious practices of the peoples who branded it a "vile superstition." Obviously something very strange happened between the times of the early Christians, and the times in which Christianity became the established religion. And whatever it was that happened, changed Christianity from a "vile superstition" to an acceptable, all-inclusive, monotheistic device. In short, it seems evident that "true Christianity" has completely disappeared from the world stage and those individuals who call themselves Christian are not, in fact, Christians in the original sense of the word by any stretch of the imagination.

The question that comes to mind is: what would the peoples of that time have considered a "vile superstition," when one is aware of what they considered normal religious practice? The only thing that seemed to fit the bill, so to say, is the possibility that whoever was the figure around which the Jesus legend was wrapped, was teaching that the "God of this world" was an "evil magician." Not only that, but that he probably suggested that man is the manifestation of God, and all creation is the "body of God," and that there was no point in praying to an "external god" at all. Now that would have set just about everybody back then on fire! To suggest that sacrifice to the gods, that appeasing the gods, that honoring the gods, that praying to the gods, that expecting to be saved by or cleansed from sin by any of the gods, was a waste of time would have been absolute heresy to all of the many religions! For them, such an idea, and only such an idea, would have been most definitely a "vile superstition."

In fact, we have something of a parallel in some remarks about Pythagoras. He was accused of believing the "vile superstitions" of the barbarians, that a soul is born over and over again into different bodies as opposed to the nonsense of the Egyptians that induced them to place all their hopes in a physical resurrection, for which purpose they went to such extremes as attempting to preserve their bodies for that future resurrection!

Clement of Alexandria writes:

    These are the times of the oldest wise men and philosophers among the Greeks. And that the most of them were barbarians by extraction, and were trained among barbarians, what need is there to say? Pythagoras is shown to have been either a Tuscan or a Tyrian. And Antisthenes was a Phrygian. And Orpheus was an Odrysian or a Thracian. The most, too, show Homer to have been an Egyptian. Thales was a Phoenician by birth, and was said to have consorted with the prophets of the Egyptians; as also Pythagoras did with the same persons, by whom he was circumcised, that he might enter the adytum and learn from the Egyptians the mystic philosophy. He held converse with the chief of the Chaldeans and the Magi; and he gave a hint of the church, now so called, in the common hall which he maintained. And Plato does not deny that he procured all that is most excellent in philosophy from the barbarians; and he admits that he came into Egypt.

    Whence, writing in the Phaedo that the philosopher can receive aid from all sides, he said: "Great indeed is Greece, O Cebes, in which everywhere there are good men, and many are the races of the barbarians."[…]

    And in the Symposium, Plato, landing the barbarians as practicing philosophy with conspicuous excellence, truly says: "And in many other instances both among Greeks and barbarians, whose temples reared for such sons are already numerous." And it is clear that the barbarians signally honoured their lawgivers and teachers, designating them gods. For, according to Plato, "they think that good souls, on quitting the supercelestial region, submit to come to this Tartarus; and assuming a body, share in all the ills which are involved in birth, from their solicitude for the race of men;" and these make laws and publish philosophy, "than which no greater boon ever came from the gods to the race of men, or will come.[…]

    And it is well known that Plato is found perpetually celebrating the barbarians, remembering that both himself and Pythagoras learned the most and the noblest of their dogmas among the barbarians.[…] [Circa AD 260-340]

But, as one notices when reading Clement, he has an agenda to validate Judaism and the New Covenant of Christianity. He identified "barbarians" as including Egyptians, Persian, Hindus, Babylonians, Phrygians, and so on. Again we find that all we can discover about the deeper beliefs of the ancient secret schools is what we hear from their detractors. In the end, Clement promoted the idea that the "true philosophy" was Hebrew, and that it was preserved most closely in the Egyptian "Mystery Schools." This twisting of the facts by someone with an agenda, has been the foundation for centuries of researchers to look in the wrong direction for the answers, and to follow the wrong clues regarding such things as the Ark of the Covenant and the Holy Grail.

The teaching of Jesus - whatever his real name was - was obviously this True Tradition, and was later corrupted and glossed by those who rewrote the Bible for purposes of power and control.

    But this is nothing new.  Time after time the Esoteric Tradition is misunderstood or deliberately buried, and so it dies.  Then, when the time is ripe, it must either be restored or rephrased.  In the meantime, the meaning is kept alive in communities or schools symbolized by the name "ark," of which Noah's Ark was one.

    A clear sign that the inner knowledge has been misunderstood is the idea that the inner knowledge is "secret."  This misunderstanding comes from a lack of comprehension of the term "inner" itself.  The impression is conveyed that these ideas are the possession of an "inner group" and are not to be given to others, when nothing could be further from the truth.  The real problem is due to what we now understand as "vectors of direction," the many "agents of the Matrix" in our reality who interpret the terminology in a purely material way, and promote their versions on the unsuspecting public.  An example is the case of the crucifixion itself.  The words that Paul used to describe "Christ crucified" have nothing to do with an historical event, and everything to do with an "inner event."  The crucifixion describes things which can and do happen within and between serious esoteric students and is a clear analogy for problems of the inner life of man which urgently require study.  Those who understand the crucifixion in a purely outward way, or who cling to the past as promoted by the Control System, miss the living tradition.

    As Jesus said:  "let the dead bury the dead."

    The fact is: inner knowledge is freely available to all those who are willing to look into themselves and face the pain that this brings.

Boris Mouravieff tells us that the Christian Esoteric Tradition has always remained alive within certain monasteries in Greece, Russia, and elsewhere.  It is true that this knowledge was hermetically hidden, but at the same time, its existence was known and access to it was never forbidden to those seriously interested in esoteric questions.

Mouravieff tells us that his commentaries are drawn directly from the Eastern Christian Tradition: the sacred texts, the commentaries written around these texts, and especially from the Philokalia which is, above all, the same teaching and discipline, transmitted by fully authorized individuals.

Attentive examination and comparison of Mouravieff's work to that of Ouspensky and Gurdjieff will show the incomplete character of the latter, as well as the deviations from the ancient doctrine.

    Christ categorically affirmed that entry into the Kingdom of God is closed to those who have not been born anew.  This second Birth is the object and goal of esoteric work.

Mouravieff tells us:

    The greatest genuine faith, human intelligence, and goodwill, are not sufficient to prevent errors and deviations in everything that touches the domain of Revelation.  The errors and deviations of Ouspensky's book [declared by Gurdjieff to have been accurate as far as it went] - attest to the fact that it was not written under the aegis of the Esoteric Brotherhood.  This means that the facts on which the book was based have a fragmentary character,  In the esoteric realm, all fragmentary knowledge is a source of danger.

As it was in the past, so it is in the present:  certain Gnostic schools, seeing the imperfection of the created world, and without searching for the reason for the existence of these imperfections, have, by a shortcut of thought, jumped to conclusions. One modern day example is the work of Dr. J.S. Chiappalone.

    The Tradition is One, whether it is the esoteric core of Hinduism, Buddhism, Sufism, or Sufism, and whoever delves deeply into these things cannot fail to note the Unity of the teachings.  All the great religions which have issued from the One Tradition are messages of truth - yet each of them addresses only part of humanity - parts with certain character.  Esoteric Christianity , in its perfect expression, aims at a general resurrection while other doctrines, even though they belong to the Truth, essentially aim at individual salvation and are therefore only partial revelations of the Tradition.

    Most of the writings of the Philokalia were intended for people who had already acquired some proficiency in esoteric studies.  One could actually say the same about the Gospels, corrupted and glossed though they be.  Bishop Theophan, in his preface to the Philokalia, insists on the fact that without help nobody can succeed in penetrating the doctrine.  This is why esoteric science conserves and cultivates an oral tradition which brings the letter to life.  Oriental Orthodoxy has known how to keep this Tradition intact by applying the absolute rule of Hermetism in each particular case.  From generation to generation, ever since the time of the Apostles, it has led its disciples up to mystic experience.

    If Hermetism has provided a safeguard for nearly twenty centuries, it must be said that circumstances have now changed.  At the current point in history, as at the time of the Coming of Christ, the veil has been partially raised.  Therefore, for those who want to advance beyond book knowledge, which never goes beyond the domain of information; for those who intensely seek the true sense of life, who want to understand the significance of the mission of those who labor in the vineyards of the Lord at the time of the Harvest, the possibility exists for initiation into this divine Wisdom, mysterious and hidden.

Mouravieff tells us that clarity of the New Testament can be extracted from obscurity by comparison to the Slavonic texts.  There are two reasons for this.  The first is that the translation of the New Testament into Slavonic was done at a time when the spirit of the texts still remained close to the original meaning.  The second is that the fixed nature of the Slavonic languages, Russian in particular, remain very close to the old Slavonic language which is still in used in the divine service of the Orthodox religion in the Slavic countries.

    The Slavonic text is generally attributed to Constantine the Philosopher, also known as St. Cyril, and to his brother St. Methodius, both learned Greeks from Salonika.  Arriving in Chersonese of Tauric, St. Cyril found, in the ninth century, that the Gospels were already written in this language, suggesting that they were produced in a period when the forms remained alive - as stated by the apostle St. Andrew, who taught Christianity in Russia in the first century of the present era… close to the time of the events.

Mouravieff notes that all serious esoteric teaching, as in ordinary education, is almost uniform.

    It is generally accepted that nobody can go on to secondary school without having completed an elementary education.  Nor can a person be admitted to a university without having a secondary education.  These graduations automatically "select" those able to become active members of the cultural elite of human society.

    Exactly the same is true in the esoteric Tradition.

    However, in our modern world, we encounter a curious phenomenon.  For example: we would not seek to discuss Newton's binomial theorem without having studied algebra, for without this, every opinion we expressed on the subject would be worthless.

Yet, in the esoteric field, we find a host of "experts" who declare their opinions on esotericism without having ever learned even the rudiments of this knowledge.

    At the same time, some of them demand "simplicity" from esoteric teachings on the generally accepted principle that Truth itself must be simple.  They conclude from this that access to Truth ought to likewise be simple.  Then they assert that the methods to access Truth must be easily assimilable.

    This argument would be perfectly correct if human beings and the problems they face were simple and just.  However, that is not the case.  There is a long road to travel from our state of distorted inner disorder to any "original simplicity."

    In practice, the doctrine of "simplicity" - if regarded as an axiom - turns the student aside from the strait gate and the narrow way that leads to Life.  Impelled by this counter-truth, he believes he stands before this door, when he is in reality - although undoubtedly in perfectly good faith - walking the wide path that leads to perdition, ad majorem Diaboli gloriam, of course.

    The Doctrine of Simplicity, correct in itself, but wrongly interpreted, becomes a snare for hearts and minds that are already too corrupt; a danger which should be recognized and avoided.

    Some people complain that the subject of the fundamentals of esotericism is not simple.  Others have said that it leads to great clarity.  This apparent contradiction is explained by the fact that esotericism is addressed to readers who are predisposed to esoteric culture by their nature, formation or personal experience.

        Jesus said: "Beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves."  And then he adds:  "You shall know them by their fruits."

    It is difficult, if not impossible, for an esoterically unevolved person to discern false prophets spontaneously.  He will recognize them more easily by their "fruits," by the observable results of their works, which serve as signs.  The Tradition knows and teaches a whole Science of signs.

        Jesus further said:  "Temptations (snares, traps set to entice to sin) are sure to come, but woe to him by or through whom they come!  It would be more profitable for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were hurled into the sea than that he should cause to sin or be a snare…"

    This warning is disturbing, but its value is real.  A thief can carry off our wealth; a 'ravening wolf' can deprive us of salvation. 

    That 'ravening wolves' appear in sheep's clothing we shall learn from the following text, well-phrased to frighten us:

        "It is not everyone that saith unto me:  Lord, Lord, who shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that accomplishes the will of my Father which is in Heaven.  Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name?  And in thy name have cast out devils?  And in thy name done many wonderful works?  And then I shall declare unto them, I never knew you: depart from Me, ye who work iniquity."

    The conclusion is that neither prophecies that are fulfilled nor the occurrence of miracles give us any surety against 'ravening wolves.'

        And in our own times: "There shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they should deceive the very elect."

    Our era is the time of Transition.  We are in the heart of this period, which is relatively short.  All the signs show that the necessary conditions for the End are emerging before our very eyes.

    This time brings with it a great preparatory task for the transition to the approaching Cycle of the Holy Spirit.  The preparatory task fundamental to the Time of Transition can and must be accomplished under the Aegis of the Absolute, for human beings and BY human beings.  Success depends upon the emergence in the near future of a sufficient number of people belonging to a new human type - torch bearers who have an innate predisposition for esoteric work.  And, it is Women who must play the inspirational role in this difficult time of Transition leading to the promised era of redemption.

    The objective of esoteric work is the march towards Consciousness, which means towards Truth.  The final aim that man can hope to achieve by esoteric work is to attain the Second Birth and so overcome Death. 

    With rare exceptions, this aim can only be attained by the student through hared and methodical work.  The sum of the conscious efforts required is proportional to the degeneracy of the Personality.

    The discipline is accepted voluntarily, but it is of iron.  The student can abandon the work at any moment to return to worldly interests.

    The freedom of choice and the initiative demanded of the seeker bring a danger: that of taking the false for the true; the impure for the pure, allowing himself to become subject to traps and snares.  When such errors are made by the pure in heart, they will be warned in time, even if they persist in their error. 

    The real danger, which can lead to mortal sin, to a definite check, occurs when an impure heart seeks to be served by higher psychic forces for its own egoistic ends.  This is a quagmire.

    A curious phenomenon often occurs in the human mind when it considers the generally hermetized theories and facts of the esoteric realm.

    In any field of science, pure, moral, applied, it is generally accepted that we must be well versed in a subject before we can give a valid opinion.  To speak seriously, one must speak of what one knows, which presupposes previous studies.

    In the esoteric domain, many purveyors of "esoteric science" believe themselves to be competent without even completing an elementary education.  They may receive all kinds of "insights" and messages from all kinds of sources, but the problem with that is that they judge these messages and teachings to be positive or true before they have even developed within themselves the correct instrument with which to judge.

    The problem is:  we KNOW that any given thing can only be conceived, understood and judged by something similar or higher.  Without this, all judgments, discussions and advice about esoteric facts remain comparable to evaluations and opinions about the shade of a specific color by someone born blind.

    Just as the world we live in is closed off, invisible to the fetus in its mother's womb until the awakening of its birth, even so the higher planes of Life, the astral and spiritual, are similarly closed and invisible to us until the Second Birth.  Until then, man can only form hypotheses or refer to the testimony of authors who have themselves been Twice born.

    As for passing valid judgments of these facts, no one can do this until he has himself crossed the second Threshold. 

    What seems clear is that it is commonplace these days for people of perfectly good faith to persist in their ignorant attitudes about esotericism.  This phenomenon is due to two principle causes.  One is the general tendency of humans to claim qualities which exist in them only in potential, and the second - a consequence of the first - is the deification of Personality.  Without doing any real, prolonged work, they "trust themselves" or rely on their own "truth" to guide them. 

    We are not speaking here of people of bad faith; we are speaking of sincere people who stray into gross error.  Their case is precisely that of the sick in need of a physician.  They are small "Sauls" who could be converted to small "Pauls," and thus might become useful laborers and earn a reward in the fields of the Lord.  But they wander in their searching beyond the place where they could receive compensation for the work that they have done.

    In esoteric work the phenomenalist mentality seeks facts.  It looks for manifestations that confirm that its work is well founded, or which simply satisfy its curiosity.  This is where the snares and traps and greatest dangers lie.  For it is often possible to obtain the desired "facts" quite easily from the astral realms, to which the human personality also belongs.  When the personality is firmly anchored in the physical body it is generally incapable of making direct connection with the astral levels.  However, certain persons, known as sensitives, have the innate or acquired faculty of momentarily weakening the ties of the personality to the physical body so that, with no esoteric evolution whatever, they are able to connect with this level - connecting to the coarsest levels of the astral.

    "Facts" obtained this way are often regarded by people who seek them as coming from the spiritual level.  However, this level is a vast reservoir of psychic entities that have no contact with the higher plane, including amongst them discarnate Personalities, who normally remain there to await their Second Death - the negative equivalent of the Second Birth.  This usually occurs on the fortieth day after death of the physical body.

    The Tradition expressly warns seekers against contacts with this realm which is so dangerous and full of the worst illusions. 

    The power of intervention of these entities in the lives of humans is a function of the credulity they meet.  The yearning to experience miracles, visions, etc, creates an atmosphere favorable for their appearance, which can assume various forms, often perceptible to the physical senses.

    In the materialist mind of the cultured man of our era, the true and the false in esoteric research easily become mixed together.  This entanglement shows above all in the domain of our affections, which are generally unbalanced in us because the habit of lying has become our true second nature.  The innate faculty of immediate discernment of the true from the false is thus lost, and man, even the most cultured and learned, becomes singularly credulous, particularly in the mystical realm.

    This imbalance affects us according to law:  credulity is inversely proportional to true faith. 

And here we must define faith: 

    Faith is an openness and trusting attitude to truth and reality, whatever it may turn out to be.  This is a risky and adventurous state of mind.  Belief, in the religious sense, is the opposite of faith – because it is a fervent wishing or hope, a compulsive clinging to the idea that the universe is arranged and governed in such and such a way.  Belief is holding to a rock; faith is learning how to swim – and this whole universe swims in boundless space.[1]

In other words, the less open we are to truth and reality, the more our credulity grows and the more we are inclined to adopt "beliefs" and rituals, often taking grotesque forms. In this mechanism we can see the familiar action of the General Law of Accident which is the essence of the Matrix: 

    To inspire the man who seeks the Way with the idea that he is already on the way.  This is the best and the most common means used by the "Devil" to turn away the seeker who has had insufficient warning from the narrow way which leads to Life.  Jesus asked:

        How can ye believe which receive glory from one another, and seek not the glory that comes from God only?

    When we accept the "glory of men," yet still believe that we are on or walking on the Way, we fall directly under the law of equilibrium.  Jesus alluded to this when he quoted the Pharisees who prayed in the streets, saying that "they have already received their reward."

    It is well understood that the human Personality, in the unfinished state in which we find it, forms our only instrument for esoteric work.  Better still, it is a gift; it is the talent the Master has given us so that we may make it bear fruit.  Woe to the servant who buries it in the earth of his body.  "Cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth."  And here, this is no metaphor. 

    We must therefore work with love and with all our strength since we do not know at what hour the Master will come.

     This being so, the attitude of the esoteric Doctrine towards lying is clear  and realistic.  ...We must fight energetically against .. useless lies.

    It is only by training of this nature that we shall progressively be able to  master the rooted tendency to lie which exists within us.  Every attempt to  hurry things, so far as lying to others is concerned, though it be a noble  attempt, is doomed to early failure.  We live in a world which is immersed in  lies and moved by lies.

    It is also necessary to guard against a variant of the habit of lying to  ourselves, one which we commonly adopt from early childhood, and against which  we must fight by every means.  This variant is widespread because at first  glance it appears to us to be a positive attitude.  ...When applied to  ourselves and for our own benefit, with the aim of softening a shock, or  regaining our inner peace after we have sinned, or excusing our actions or  faults, this idiom crystallizes within us over a period of time an auto- tranquilizing mechanism.  ...It is a true mechanism of mental anesthesia,  founded on a refined and disguised lie.  It sows hypocrisy in man towards  himself.

    This auto-tranquillizer must be destroyed."

But we see so often how desperately people want to be "tranquilize."  How  many individuals have written to us asking for an answer that would help  them feel peaceful and enable them to go to sleep at night.  They want  "positive messages."  They want a program of meditation that will make them  feel good, or something to do or "look forward to" that will ease their anxiety  when they glimpse, momentarily, the reality of the Matrix.  They want to feel  chosen and special by virtue of having been "contacted" and performing rituals without doing the absolutely agonizing work necessary to precipitate transformation.

Mouravieff continues:

    The permanent link which must be introduced between the Personality and the  real "I" is esoteric Knowledge.  The knowledge and understanding that it  permits us to acquire represent the philosopher's stone of the medieval  mystics.  They are capable of provoking in man the transmutation to which he  aspires.

    We must work ceaselessly, for fear of not succeeding in time.  One must work,  says Jesus,  "while it is day: the night comes when no man can work."

These commentaries of Mouravieff are absolutely invaluable, and would be helpful to every seeker on the path and reader of the Cassiopaean Material.  This is especially so because Mouravieff actually describes  things that  we have already experienced, even though we did not precisely  understand what it was we were doing, how or even why.

For example,  Mouravieff calls the influences of the material world, the Matrix, the  predator's mind, etc, the "A influences."  (He has diagrams showing how they  affect the consciousness.)  The influences of the esoteric center, the "real  world" concealed by the "matrix illusion," the "truth," are called "B  influences." 

He writes:

    If a man spends his life without distinguishing between "A" and "B"  influences, he will end as he started, one could say mechanically, driven by  the Law of Accident.  ...He can have a brilliant career in the meaning the  world gives to this expression.  Yet he will come to the end of his days  without having either learned or understood anything of the Reality.  And dust  returns to dust.

    In life, every being is subjected to a sort of competitive test.  If he  discerns the existence of the "B" influences; if he acquires a taste for  gathering and absorbing them; if he continually aspires to assimilate them  better; his mixed inner nature will slowly undergo a certain kind of evolution.

    And if the efforts which he makes to absorb the "B" influences are constant  and sufficient in force, a magnetic centre can be formed within him. 

    If this center once born in him is carefully developed, it takes form, and in  its turn will exercise an influence over the results of the "A" influences  which are always active, deflecting them.

    Such deflection may be violent.  In general it transgresses the laws of  exterior life and provokes many conflicts in and around man.  If he loses the  battle, he emerges with the conviction the the "B" influences are nothing but  illusion: that the only reality is represented by the "A" influences.  Slowly,  the magnetic center which had been formed within him is reabsorbed and  vanishes.  Then, from the esoteric point of view, his situation is worse than  the one he had started with, when he was just beginning to discern "B"  influences.

    But, if he emerges a winner in this FIRST struggle, his magnetic centre,  consolidated and reinforced, will draw him to a man having a "C" influence  stronger than his own, and possessing a stronger magnetic center.  And so on in  succession, the last man being in connection with another having in influence  "D", who will be his link with the Esoteric Center "E."

    Henceforth in life, that man will no longer be isolated. 

    To the measure of its growth, the man will escape the dominion of the law of  accident and enter the domain of consciousness.

Mouravieff then shows a diagram of the person who deludes himself and does not  struggle against the lies of the Matrix... who has not engaged in the work of  stripping away lies:

    This second figure, with black magnetic centers, represents the situation  where man deludes himself and, believing he is absorbing "B" influences and  making the necessary selection all the while, he in fact absorbs "A"  influences... This will put him into contact with people who possess magnetic  centers of the same nature: who are themselves duped or who dupe others, and  who have no direct or indirect link with the esoteric Center.

In both the Wave Series and the Adventure Series, we have been dealing with identifying these very influences and emphasizing the necessity of "collecting" the "A" influences in terms of "seeing the unseen" of what we have called the Theological Reality. We have also met many characters that are aptly described by Mouravieff in his diagram of those individuals who have deluded themselves and have created a magnetic center of negativity, and how they attract to themselves others with similar negative magnetic centers.

In other words, the activities described in the Adventures series - the constant questioning,  stripping, looking at what is difficult and dealing with it - the shocks of  seeing the Matrix, the "man behind the curtain," the effort to "see the unseen"  is the very activity of collecting these "B" influences which then lead to the  "magnetic center," or "lodestar," as the C's called it.

    Q: When I post material on the website, those people who resonate to the material believe that this refers to them also. I have been of the opinion that Unified Thought Form being must mean a very large group as represented in this density. I know that we are dealing with limiting terms. But, is this applied to people who CHOOSE the Cassiopaean option?
    A: Maybe it is best to say it applies to those who recognize the application.
    Q: So, if they recognize it, if they know it is them, they are part of it. (A) But, thinking in nonlinear terms, its up to us to work to make this precise. You are asking this question which implies that the answer exists. But, exactly what the answer is may be it is not yet chosen, and it is up to us to make it this way.
    A: Lodestar is a clue for you.

Mouravieff writes:

    This evolution seems a long process, an uninterrupted combat with a series of  successes and falls.  More than once, he who searches will fall into crises of  discouragement; more than once it will seem to him that he is being driven  beyond the limits of his own life; he will sometimes feel crushed under the  burden of the tests and difficulties against which he will be pitted during his  search. 

    This can be understood when we know that esoteric science in its teaching goes  far beyond simple information.  Its purpose, in fact, is nothing less than the  TRANSFORMATION of the very being of those who study it...

    In every case where esoteric science offers ALL, it demands ALL in return.  One  must pay all.

    It is impossible to reach the true by the path of lies or hypocritical games,  because in this case we seek to BE, rather than to "appear to be."

Mouravieff describes the reaction of the "matrix/ B influences" to the person  who is on the Path:

    As long as man accepts the principle of the final annihilation of his  Personality without a fight, he can carry on in life without attracting the  increasing pressure of the General Law of Accident upon himself.

    The case is totally different if he struggles to surpass the limits which it  imposes.  He then runs against the action upon him of this Law and its  derivatives.  It acts simultaneously on several planes: physical, mental and  moral.  Its action on the moral plane is conceived by man, since time  immemorial, in the form of the personification: the Devil."

We are also reminded of Gurdjieff's remarks about the "mechanical force"  having promoters and adherents at very high levels who act under its powerful  influences.  We suggest that both are 4 and 5 D STS beings.

    ...Once the first positive results are obtained those students will  unmistakable run up against the active opposition of the law and the "game of  the Crafty One."

    It must be realized that in placing himself under the aegis of the Law of  Exception, man goes against the General Law of Accident, which he is even   called upon to overthrow, if only on the individual scale.  He must no forget -  under penalty of "surprise attack" - that salvation depends on victory over the  Devil, which, as we have said, is the personalized moral aspect of the General  Law of Accident.  This is so even though this, being a cosmic law, is naturally  a divine law. 

    One must not be afraid, as the Law of Exception is also a divine law.

    In choosing it, man continues to serve the interest of the whole, but  differently and in an incomparably more efficient manner.

    During his fight against the first law, he is subject to tests that often take  the form of temptations.  ...We are permitted to draw attention to the indirect  nature of diabolical action.

    If, aiming straight towards his goal, which is liberation and salvation, the  seeker successfully overcomes the obstacles and by this shows proof of a  strength that would permit him to defy the authority of the General Law, the  latter will begin to act upon him indirectly, generally by the mediation of his  near ones if they do not follow the same path:  this action occurs on the moral  plane, and often takes emotional forms appealing to his most noble, generous  and disinterested sentiments: to his charity; his obligation; his pity.  It  impels him down blind alleys, insinuating that he will thus be returning to his  duty, that by so doing he will go on walking in the right path, etc. 

    This will clarify the profound saying of Jesus that : "A man's worst enemies  are those of his own household."

    Let us repeat:  esoteric work is by its nature a revolutionary work.  The  seeker seeks a change of state: to overcome Death and attain Salvation.  This  is the goal give to this work by the scriptures:  "If ye live after the flesh,  ye must die."

    The man who lives passively under the first law, insensibly and without being  aware of it  - even as an excellent citizen - involves himself in "The broad  way that leadeth to destruction; he who chooses the Law of Exception takes :  "The narrow road that leadeth to life."

Commentary on Boris Mouravieff's Gnosis

The cult of Demeter which celebrated the Eleusinian rites was well established in Mycenaea in the 13th century BC, and it is more than likely that the Feast of Tabernacles in Canaan was an offshoot of this activity. Our sources of information regarding the Eleusinian Mysteries include the ruins of the sanctuary there; numerous statues, bas reliefs, and pottery. We also have reports from ancient writers such as Aeschylos, Sophocles, Herodotus, Aristophanes, Plutarch, and Pausanias - all of whom were initiates - as well as the accounts of Christian commentators like Clement of Alexandria, Hippolytus, Tertullian, and Astorias, who were critics and not initiates. Yet for all this evidence, the true nature of the Mysteries remains shrouded in uncertainty because the participants were remarkably steadfast in honoring their pledge not to reveal what took place in the Telesterion, or inner sanctum of the Temple of Demeter. To violate that oath of secrecy was a capital offense. For these reasons,scholars today must make use of circumstantial evidence and inferences, with the result that there is still no consensus as to what did or did not take place.

Many experts have concluded - probably erroneously - that the Mysteries at Eleusis originally must have come from Egypt. The fact is, the sanctuary ruins in Eleusis evidently go back centuries earlier than the Egyptian Hymn to Demeter recited by Homer that is often cited as the proof that the origin was Egyptian. What is more, the excavations have unearthed no Egyptian artifacts there from that period.

Many scholars today favor the view that the cult of Demeter probably derived from Thessaly or Thrace. They base this conclusion partly on references in Homer and other ancient authors to some evidently pre-Dorian temples to Demeter in the Thessalian towns of Thermopylae, Pyrasos, and Pherai; partly on certain etymological links connecting key words in the rites of Demeter to pre-Hellenic dialects from the north . Other scholars point out that Demeter may be the same as a goddess "Dameter," who is mentioned briefly in Linear B tablets from Pylos dating from approximately 1200 BC. This evidence suggests that the cult of Demeter may after all have originated in the southern Peleponnesus.

In any case, whether the specific cult of Demeter at Eleusis originated in northern or southern Greece, the undeniable parallels with worship of grain goddesses in other parts of the eastern Mediterranean region point to frequent contacts and the cross-fertilization of religious ideas. And we certainly think that the Canaanite Feast of Tabernacles was a corrupted version of some more ancient form.

As it happens, the term "Thesmophoria" is derived from thesmoi, meaning "laws," and phoria, "carrying," in reference to the goddess as "law-bearer." But the symbolism of the ark as the "law bearer" in the "tent of meeting," or the "Mother-Delta," the "doorway to the higher realms," replaced the original meaning and the role of women in the process. Based on our own researches, we believe that True Christianity - which is almost virtually unknown today - was a resurgence of a very ancient Tradition - and that this same Tradition was preserved, in part, in Shamanic lore, was part of the Cathar beliefs as well as the true meaning of the Grail legends.

Jessie L. Weston writes in From Ritual to Romance:

    The more closely one studies pre-Christian Theology, the more strongly one is impressed with the deeply and daringly spiritual character of its speculations, and the more doubtful it appears that such teaching can depend upon the unaided processes of human thought, or can have been evolved from such germs as we find among the supposedly 'primitive' peoples... Are they really primitive? Or are we dealing, not with the primary elements of religion, but with the disjecta membra of a vanished civilization?

    Certain it is that so far as historical evidence goes our earliest records point to the recognition of a spiritual, not of a material, origin of the human race. Students of the Grail literature cannot fail to have been impressed by a certain atmosphere of awe and mystery which surrounds that enigmatic Vessel. There is a secret connected with it, the revelation of which will entail dire misfortune on the betrayer. [...] It is so secret a thing that no woman, be she wife or maid, may venture to speak of it. [...]

    There is no doubt that the Grail was something secret, mysterious and awful, the exact knowledge of which was reserved to a select few. […] The Nature Cults still remain reliable guides; it is their inner, their esoteric, ritual which will enable us to bridge the gulf between what appears at first sight the wholly irreconcilable elements of Folk-tale and high Spiritual mystery."

In our work on Noah, we have tracked the Grail legends back to prehistoric times - in Western Europe and Central Asia - via the very area emphasized in many other ancient myths, including that of Jason and the Argonauts: Colchis and the Caucasus regions. Mircea Eliade writes:

    Recent researches have clearly brought out the "shamanic" elements in the religion of the paleolithic hunters. Horst Kierchner has interpreted the celebrated relief at Lascaux as a representation of a shamanic trance. The same author considers that the "kommandostabe" - mysterious objects found in prehistoric sites - are drumsticks. If this interpretation is accepted, the prehistoric sorcerers would already have used drums comparable to those of the Siberian shamans.

    Finally, Karl J. Narr has reconsidered the problem of the "origin" and chronology of shamanism in his important study. He brings out the influence of notions of fertility (Venus statuettes) on the religious beliefs of the prehistoric North Asian hunters; but this influence did not disrupt the paleolithic tradition. His conclusions are as follows: Animal skulls and bones found in the sites of the European Paleolithic (before 50,000 - ca. 30,000 BC) can be interpreted as ritual offerings. [...] Soon afterward, probably about 25,000 BC, Europe offers evidence for the earliest forms of shamanism (Lascaux) with the plastic representations of the bird, the tutelary spirit, and ecstasy. [...]

    What appears to be certain is the antiquity of "shamanic" rituals and symbols. It remains to be determined whether these documents brought to light by prehistoric discoveries represent the first expressions of a shamanism in statu nascendi or are merely the earliest documents today available for an earlier religious complex, which, however, did not find "plastic" manifestations (drawings, ritual objects, etc) before the period of Lascaux.[…]

    Everywhere in those lands, [ in Central and North Asia,] and from the earliest times, we find documents for the existence of a Supreme Being of celestial structure, who also corresponds morphologically to all the other Supreme Beings of the archaic religions. The symbolism of ascent, with all the rites and myths dependent on it, must be connected with celestial Supreme Beings; we know that "height" was sacred as such, that many supreme gods of archaic peoples are called "He on high," or "he of the Sky," or simply "Sky." This symbolism of ascent and "height" retains its value even after the "withdrawal" of the celestial Supreme Being - for, as is well known, Supreme Beings gradually lose their active place in the cult, giving way to religious forms that are more "dynamic" and "familiar" (the gods of storm and fertility, demiurges, the souls of the dead, the Great Goddesses, etc.) […]

    The reduction or even the total loss in religious currency of uranian Supreme Beings is sometimes indicated in myths concerning a primordial and paradisal time when communications between heaven and earth were easy and accessible to everyone; as the result of some happening, these communications were broken off and the Supreme Beings withdrew to the highest sky.[…]

    The disappearance of the cult of the celestial Supreme Being did not nullify the symbolism of ascent with all its implication. […] The shamanic ecstasy could be considered a reactualization of the mythical illud tempus when men could communicate in concreto with the sky. It is indubitable that the celestial ascent of the shaman is a survival, profoundly modified and sometimes degenerate, of this archaic religious ideology centered on faith in a celestial Supreme Being and belief in concrete communications between heaven and earth. […] The myths refer to more intimate relations between the Supreme Beings and shamans; in particular, they tell of a First Shaman, sent to earth by the Supreme Being or his surrogate to defend human beings against diseases and evil spirits.

    This historical change in the religions of Central and North Asia […] in turn altered the meaning of the shaman's ecstatic experience. Descents to the underworld, the struggle against evil spirits, the increasingly familiar relations with "spirits" that result in their "embodiment" or in the shaman's being "possessed" by "spirits," are innovations, most of them recent. In addition, there are the influences from the south, which appeared quite early and which altered both cosmology and the mythology and techniques of ecstasy. Among these southern influences we must reckon, in later times, the contribution of Buddhism and Lamaism, added to the Iranian and, in the last analysis, Mesopotamian influences that preceded them.

    The initiatory schema of the shaman's ritual death and resurrection is likewise an innovation, but one that goes back to much earlier times; in any case, it cannot be ascribed to influences from the ancient Near East. But the innovations introduced by the ancestor cult particularly affected the structure of this initatory schema. The very concept of mystical death was altered by the many and various religious changes effected by lunar mythologies, the cult of the dead, and the elaboration of magical ideologies.[including Egyptian]

    Hence we must conceive of Asiatic shamanism as an archaic technique of ecstasy whose original underlying ideology - belief in a celestial Supreme Being with whom it was possible to have direct relations by ascending into the sky - was constantly being transformed by a ongoing series of exotic contributions culminating in the invasion of Buddhism.

    The concept of mystical death, furthermore, encouraged increasingly regular relations with the ancestral souls and the "spirits," relations that ended in "possession." The phenomenology of the trance underwent many changes and corruptions, due in large part to confusion as to the precise nature of ecstasy. Yet all these innovations and corruptions did not succeed in eliminating the possibility of the true shamanic ecstasy.

    More than once we have discerned in the shamanic experience a "nostalgia for paradise" that suggests one of the oldest types of Christian mystical experience. As for the "inner light," which plays a part of the first importance in Indian mysticism and metaphysics as well as in Christian mystical theology, it is already documented in shamanism.

    But shamanism is important not only for the place that it holds in the history of mysticism. The shamans have played an essential role in the defense of the psychic integrity of the community They are preeminently the antidemonic champions; they combat not only demons and disease, but also the black magicians. [A shaman is a] tireless slayer of demons. The military elements that are of great importance in certain types of Asian shamanism (lance, cuirass, bow, sword, etc.) are accounted for by the requirements of war against the demons, the true enemies of humanity. In a way it can be said that shamanism defends life, health, fertility, the world of "light," against death, diseases, sterility, disaster, and the world of "darkness."[...]

    What is fundamental and universal is the shaman's struggle against what we could call "the powers of evil." […] The shaman's essential role in the defense of the psychic integrity of the community depends above all on this: men are sure that one of them is able to help them in the critical circumstances produced by the inhabitants of the invisible world. […] A member of the community is able to see what is hidden and invisible to the rest and to bring back direct and reliable information from the supernatural worlds.[…]

    We have already referred to the likenesses between the accounts of shamanic ecstasies and certain epic themes in oral literature. The shaman's adventures in the other world, the ordeals that he undergoes in his ecstatic descents below and ascents to the sky, suggest the adventures of the figures in popular tales and the heroes of epic literature. Probably a large number of epic "subjects" or motifs, as well as many characters, images, and cliches of epic literature, are, finally, of ecstatic origin, in the sense that they were borrowed from the narrative of shamans describing their journeys and adventures in the superhuman worlds. [ Eliade, Mircea, Shamanism, Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy.]

In short, we suggest that Esoteric Christianity - the REAL teachings of Jesus - were a revival of the most ancient of True Traditions of Freedom - an antediluvian tradition handed down from the Ancient Athenians of Plato's myth - the defenders of the world against the Evil Empire of Atlantis. This Evil Empire of Atlantis is reincarnated in the present day - the controlling empire of our world - and seeks to establish a One World control system exactly as Atlantis did ages ago. Part of the means of doing this includes brainwashing the masses, even those who are seeking alternative explanations in philosophy and religion. For those who seek outside the already corrupted standard religions, there is now the Stargate Conspiracy - the promotion of Egyptian and South American mysticism as the source of the Tradition. And it is a lie.

Christianity is quite interesting when one removes the obvious gloss of the Egyptian resurrection myth. When the reader is fully informed about the variations on these two themes, it is almost pathetically easy to read the New Testament and see what might be original to "Jesus," and what was added by the "creators" of Christianity as we know it.

What is even more interesting was the fact that the only writings contemporary to the times of early Christianity, which mention it specifically, remark that it is a "vile superstition." Yet, what we have as Christianity today, is nothing more or less than the same religious practices of the peoples who branded it a "vile superstition." Obviously something very strange happened between the times of the early Christians, and the times in which Christianity became the established religion. And whatever it was that happened, changed Christianity from a "vile superstition" to an acceptable, all-inclusive, monotheistic device. In short, it seems evident that "true Christianity" has completely disappeared from the world stage and those individuals who call themselves Christian are not, in fact, Christians in the original sense of the word by any stretch of the imagination.

The question that comes to mind is: what would the peoples of that time have considered a "vile superstition," when one is aware of what they considered normal religious practice? The only thing that seemed to fit the bill, so to say, is the possibility that whoever was the figure around which the Jesus legend was wrapped, was teaching that the "God of this world" was an "evil magician." Not only that, but that he probably suggested that man is the manifestation of God, and all creation is the "body of God," and that there was no point in praying to an "external god" at all. Now that would have set just about everybody back then on fire! To suggest that sacrifice to the gods, that appeasing the gods, that honoring the gods, that praying to the gods, that expecting to be saved by or cleansed from sin by any of the gods, was a waste of time would have been absolute heresy to all of the many religions! For them, such an idea, and only such an idea, would have been most definitely a "vile superstition."

In fact, we have something of a parallel in some remarks about Pythagoras. He was accused of believing the "vile superstitions" of the barbarians, that a soul is born over and over again into different bodies as opposed to the nonsense of the Egyptians that induced them to place all their hopes in a physical resurrection, for which purpose they went to such extremes as attempting to preserve their bodies for that future resurrection!

Clement of Alexandria writes:

    These are the times of the oldest wise men and philosophers among the Greeks. And that the most of them were barbarians by extraction, and were trained among barbarians, what need is there to say? Pythagoras is shown to have been either a Tuscan or a Tyrian. And Antisthenes was a Phrygian. And Orpheus was an Odrysian or a Thracian. The most, too, show Homer to have been an Egyptian. Thales was a Phoenician by birth, and was said to have consorted with the prophets of the Egyptians; as also Pythagoras did with the same persons, by whom he was circumcised, that he might enter the adytum and learn from the Egyptians the mystic philosophy. He held converse with the chief of the Chaldeans and the Magi; and he gave a hint of the church, now so called, in the common hall which he maintained. And Plato does not deny that he procured all that is most excellent in philosophy from the barbarians; and he admits that he came into Egypt.

    Whence, writing in the Phaedo that the philosopher can receive aid from all sides, he said: "Great indeed is Greece, O Cebes, in which everywhere there are good men, and many are the races of the barbarians."[…]

    And in the Symposium, Plato, landing the barbarians as practicing philosophy with conspicuous excellence, truly says: "And in many other instances both among Greeks and barbarians, whose temples reared for such sons are already numerous." And it is clear that the barbarians signally honoured their lawgivers and teachers, designating them gods. For, according to Plato, "they think that good souls, on quitting the supercelestial region, submit to come to this Tartarus; and assuming a body, share in all the ills which are involved in birth, from their solicitude for the race of men;" and these make laws and publish philosophy, "than which no greater boon ever came from the gods to the race of men, or will come.[…]

    And it is well known that Plato is found perpetually celebrating the barbarians, remembering that both himself and Pythagoras learned the most and the noblest of their dogmas among the barbarians.[…] [Circa AD 260-340]

But, as one notices when reading Clement, he has an agenda to validate Judaism and the New Covenant of Christianity. He identified "barbarians" as including Egyptians, Persian, Hindus, Babylonians, Phrygians, and so on. Again we find that all we can discover about the deeper beliefs of the ancient secret schools is what we hear from their detractors. In the end, Clement promoted the idea that the "true philosophy" was Hebrew, and that it was preserved most closely in the Egyptian "Mystery Schools." This twisting of the facts by someone with an agenda, has been the foundation for centuries of researchers to look in the wrong direction for the answers, and to follow the wrong clues regarding such things as the Ark of the Covenant and the Holy Grail.

The teaching of Jesus - whatever his real name was - was obviously this True Tradition, and was later corrupted and glossed by those who rewrote the Bible for purposes of power and control.

    But this is nothing new.  Time after time the Esoteric Tradition is misunderstood or deliberately buried, and so it dies.  Then, when the time is ripe, it must either be restored or rephrased.  In the meantime, the meaning is kept alive in communities or schools symbolized by the name "ark," of which Noah's Ark was one.

    A clear sign that the inner knowledge has been misunderstood is the idea that the inner knowledge is "secret."  This misunderstanding comes from a lack of comprehension of the term "inner" itself.  The impression is conveyed that these ideas are the possession of an "inner group" and are not to be given to others, when nothing could be further from the truth.  The real problem is due to what we now understand as "vectors of direction," the many "agents of the Matrix" in our reality who interpret the terminology in a purely material way, and promote their versions on the unsuspecting public.  An example is the case of the crucifixion itself.  The words that Paul used to describe "Christ crucified" have nothing to do with an historical event, and everything to do with an "inner event."  The crucifixion describes things which can and do happen within and between serious esoteric students and is a clear analogy for problems of the inner life of man which urgently require study.  Those who understand the crucifixion in a purely outward way, or who cling to the past as promoted by the Control System, miss the living tradition.

    As Jesus said:  "let the dead bury the dead."

    The fact is: inner knowledge is freely available to all those who are willing to look into themselves and face the pain that this brings.

Boris Mouravieff tells us that the Christian Esoteric Tradition has always remained alive within certain monasteries in Greece, Russia, and elsewhere.  It is true that this knowledge was hermetically hidden, but at the same time, its existence was known and access to it was never forbidden to those seriously interested in esoteric questions.

Mouravieff tells us that his commentaries are drawn directly from the Eastern Christian Tradition: the sacred texts, the commentaries written around these texts, and especially from the Philokalia which is, above all, the same teaching and discipline, transmitted by fully authorized individuals.

Attentive examination and comparison of Mouravieff's work to that of Ouspensky and Gurdjieff will show the incomplete character of the latter, as well as the deviations from the ancient doctrine.

    Christ categorically affirmed that entry into the Kingdom of God is closed to those who have not been born anew.  This second Birth is the object and goal of esoteric work.

Mouravieff tells us:

    The greatest genuine faith, human intelligence, and goodwill, are not sufficient to prevent errors and deviations in everything that touches the domain of Revelation.  The errors and deviations of Ouspensky's book [declared by Gurdjieff to have been accurate as far as it went] - attest to the fact that it was not written under the aegis of the Esoteric Brotherhood.  This means that the facts on which the book was based have a fragmentary character,  In the esoteric realm, all fragmentary knowledge is a source of danger.

As it was in the past, so it is in the present:  certain Gnostic schools, seeing the imperfection of the created world, and without searching for the reason for the existence of these imperfections, have, by a shortcut of thought, jumped to conclusions. One modern day example is the work of Dr. J.S. Chiappalone.

    The Tradition is One, whether it is the esoteric core of Hinduism, Buddhism, Sufism, or Sufism, and whoever delves deeply into these things cannot fail to note the Unity of the teachings.  All the great religions which have issued from the One Tradition are messages of truth - yet each of them addresses only part of humanity - parts with certain character.  Esoteric Christianity , in its perfect expression, aims at a general resurrection while other doctrines, even though they belong to the Truth, essentially aim at individual salvation and are therefore only partial revelations of the Tradition.

    Most of the writings of the Philokalia were intended for people who had already acquired some proficiency in esoteric studies.  One could actually say the same about the Gospels, corrupted and glossed though they be.  Bishop Theophan, in his preface to the Philokalia, insists on the fact that without help nobody can succeed in penetrating the doctrine.  This is why esoteric science conserves and cultivates an oral tradition which brings the letter to life.  Oriental Orthodoxy has known how to keep this Tradition intact by applying the absolute rule of Hermetism in each particular case.  From generation to generation, ever since the time of the Apostles, it has led its disciples up to mystic experience.

    If Hermetism has provided a safeguard for nearly twenty centuries, it must be said that circumstances have now changed.  At the current point in history, as at the time of the Coming of Christ, the veil has been partially raised.  Therefore, for those who want to advance beyond book knowledge, which never goes beyond the domain of information; for those who intensely seek the true sense of life, who want to understand the significance of the mission of those who labor in the vineyards of the Lord at the time of the Harvest, the possibility exists for initiation into this divine Wisdom, mysterious and hidden.

Mouravieff tells us that clarity of the New Testament can be extracted from obscurity by comparison to the Slavonic texts.  There are two reasons for this.  The first is that the translation of the New Testament into Slavonic was done at a time when the spirit of the texts still remained close to the original meaning.  The second is that the fixed nature of the Slavonic languages, Russian in particular, remain very close to the old Slavonic language which is still in used in the divine service of the Orthodox religion in the Slavic countries.

    The Slavonic text is generally attributed to Constantine the Philosopher, also known as St. Cyril, and to his brother St. Methodius, both learned Greeks from Salonika.  Arriving in Chersonese of Tauric, St. Cyril found, in the ninth century, that the Gospels were already written in this language, suggesting that they were produced in a period when the forms remained alive - as stated by the apostle St. Andrew, who taught Christianity in Russia in the first century of the present era… close to the time of the events.

Mouravieff notes that all serious esoteric teaching, as in ordinary education, is almost uniform.

    It is generally accepted that nobody can go on to secondary school without having completed an elementary education.  Nor can a person be admitted to a university without having a secondary education.  These graduations automatically "select" those able to become active members of the cultural elite of human society.

    Exactly the same is true in the esoteric Tradition.

    However, in our modern world, we encounter a curious phenomenon.  For example: we would not seek to discuss Newton's binomial theorem without having studied algebra, for without this, every opinion we expressed on the subject would be worthless.

Yet, in the esoteric field, we find a host of "experts" who declare their opinions on esotericism without having ever learned even the rudiments of this knowledge.

    At the same time, some of them demand "simplicity" from esoteric teachings on the generally accepted principle that Truth itself must be simple.  They conclude from this that access to Truth ought to likewise be simple.  Then they assert that the methods to access Truth must be easily assimilable.

    This argument would be perfectly correct if human beings and the problems they face were simple and just.  However, that is not the case.  There is a long road to travel from our state of distorted inner disorder to any "original simplicity."

    In practice, the doctrine of "simplicity" - if regarded as an axiom - turns the student aside from the strait gate and the narrow way that leads to Life.  Impelled by this counter-truth, he believes he stands before this door, when he is in reality - although undoubtedly in perfectly good faith - walking the wide path that leads to perdition, ad majorem Diaboli gloriam, of course.

    The Doctrine of Simplicity, correct in itself, but wrongly interpreted, becomes a snare for hearts and minds that are already too corrupt; a danger which should be recognized and avoided.

    Some people complain that the subject of the fundamentals of esotericism is not simple.  Others have said that it leads to great clarity.  This apparent contradiction is explained by the fact that esotericism is addressed to readers who are predisposed to esoteric culture by their nature, formation or personal experience.

        Jesus said: "Beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves."  And then he adds:  "You shall know them by their fruits."

    It is difficult, if not impossible, for an esoterically unevolved person to discern false prophets spontaneously.  He will recognize them more easily by their "fruits," by the observable results of their works, which serve as signs.  The Tradition knows and teaches a whole Science of signs.

        Jesus further said:  "Temptations (snares, traps set to entice to sin) are sure to come, but woe to him by or through whom they come!  It would be more profitable for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were hurled into the sea than that he should cause to sin or be a snare…"

    This warning is disturbing, but its value is real.  A thief can carry off our wealth; a 'ravening wolf' can deprive us of salvation. 

    That 'ravening wolves' appear in sheep's clothing we shall learn from the following text, well-phrased to frighten us:

        "It is not everyone that saith unto me:  Lord, Lord, who shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that accomplishes the will of my Father which is in Heaven.  Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name?  And in thy name have cast out devils?  And in thy name done many wonderful works?  And then I shall declare unto them, I never knew you: depart from Me, ye who work iniquity."

    The conclusion is that neither prophecies that are fulfilled nor the occurrence of miracles give us any surety against 'ravening wolves.'

        And in our own times: "There shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they should deceive the very elect."

    Our era is the time of Transition.  We are in the heart of this period, which is relatively short.  All the signs show that the necessary conditions for the End are emerging before our very eyes.

    This time brings with it a great preparatory task for the transition to the approaching Cycle of the Holy Spirit.  The preparatory task fundamental to the Time of Transition can and must be accomplished under the Aegis of the Absolute, for human beings and BY human beings.  Success depends upon the emergence in the near future of a sufficient number of people belonging to a new human type - torch bearers who have an innate predisposition for esoteric work.  And, it is Women who must play the inspirational role in this difficult time of Transition leading to the promised era of redemption.

    The objective of esoteric work is the march towards Consciousness, which means towards Truth.  The final aim that man can hope to achieve by esoteric work is to attain the Second Birth and so overcome Death. 

    With rare exceptions, this aim can only be attained by the student through hared and methodical work.  The sum of the conscious efforts required is proportional to the degeneracy of the Personality.

    The discipline is accepted voluntarily, but it is of iron.  The student can abandon the work at any moment to return to worldly interests.

    The freedom of choice and the initiative demanded of the seeker bring a danger: that of taking the false for the true; the impure for the pure, allowing himself to become subject to traps and snares.  When such errors are made by the pure in heart, they will be warned in time, even if they persist in their error. 

    The real danger, which can lead to mortal sin, to a definite check, occurs when an impure heart seeks to be served by higher psychic forces for its own egoistic ends.  This is a quagmire.

    A curious phenomenon often occurs in the human mind when it considers the generally hermetized theories and facts of the esoteric realm.

    In any field of science, pure, moral, applied, it is generally accepted that we must be well versed in a subject before we can give a valid opinion.  To speak seriously, one must speak of what one knows, which presupposes previous studies.

    In the esoteric domain, many purveyors of "esoteric science" believe themselves to be competent without even completing an elementary education.  They may receive all kinds of "insights" and messages from all kinds of sources, but the problem with that is that they judge these messages and teachings to be positive or true before they have even developed within themselves the correct instrument with which to judge.

    The problem is:  we KNOW that any given thing can only be conceived, understood and judged by something similar or higher.  Without this, all judgments, discussions and advice about esoteric facts remain comparable to evaluations and opinions about the shade of a specific color by someone born blind.

    Just as the world we live in is closed off, invisible to the fetus in its mother's womb until the awakening of its birth, even so the higher planes of Life, the astral and spiritual, are similarly closed and invisible to us until the Second Birth.  Until then, man can only form hypotheses or refer to the testimony of authors who have themselves been Twice born.

    As for passing valid judgments of these facts, no one can do this until he has himself crossed the second Threshold. 

    What seems clear is that it is commonplace these days for people of perfectly good faith to persist in their ignorant attitudes about esotericism.  This phenomenon is due to two principle causes.  One is the general tendency of humans to claim qualities which exist in them only in potential, and the second - a consequence of the first - is the deification of Personality.  Without doing any real, prolonged work, they "trust themselves" or rely on their own "truth" to guide them. 

    We are not speaking here of people of bad faith; we are speaking of sincere people who stray into gross error.  Their case is precisely that of the sick in need of a physician.  They are small "Sauls" who could be converted to small "Pauls," and thus might become useful laborers and earn a reward in the fields of the Lord.  But they wander in their searching beyond the place where they could receive compensation for the work that they have done.

    In esoteric work the phenomenalist mentality seeks facts.  It looks for manifestations that confirm that its work is well founded, or which simply satisfy its curiosity.  This is where the snares and traps and greatest dangers lie.  For it is often possible to obtain the desired "facts" quite easily from the astral realms, to which the human personality also belongs.  When the personality is firmly anchored in the physical body it is generally incapable of making direct connection with the astral levels.  However, certain persons, known as sensitives, have the innate or acquired faculty of momentarily weakening the ties of the personality to the physical body so that, with no esoteric evolution whatever, they are able to connect with this level - connecting to the coarsest levels of the astral.

    "Facts" obtained this way are often regarded by people who seek them as coming from the spiritual level.  However, this level is a vast reservoir of psychic entities that have no contact with the higher plane, including amongst them discarnate Personalities, who normally remain there to await their Second Death - the negative equivalent of the Second Birth.  This usually occurs on the fortieth day after death of the physical body.

    The Tradition expressly warns seekers against contacts with this realm which is so dangerous and full of the worst illusions. 

    The power of intervention of these entities in the lives of humans is a function of the credulity they meet.  The yearning to experience miracles, visions, etc, creates an atmosphere favorable for their appearance, which can assume various forms, often perceptible to the physical senses.

    In the materialist mind of the cultured man of our era, the true and the false in esoteric research easily become mixed together.  This entanglement shows above all in the domain of our affections, which are generally unbalanced in us because the habit of lying has become our true second nature.  The innate faculty of immediate discernment of the true from the false is thus lost, and man, even the most cultured and learned, becomes singularly credulous, particularly in the mystical realm.

    This imbalance affects us according to law:  credulity is inversely proportional to true faith. 

And here we must define faith: 

    Faith is an openness and trusting attitude to truth and reality, whatever it may turn out to be.  This is a risky and adventurous state of mind.  Belief, in the religious sense, is the opposite of faith – because it is a fervent wishing or hope, a compulsive clinging to the idea that the universe is arranged and governed in such and such a way.  Belief is holding to a rock; faith is learning how to swim – and this whole universe swims in boundless space.[1]

In other words, the less open we are to truth and reality, the more our credulity grows and the more we are inclined to adopt "beliefs" and rituals, often taking grotesque forms. In this mechanism we can see the familiar action of the General Law of Accident which is the essence of the Matrix: 

    To inspire the man who seeks the Way with the idea that he is already on the way.  This is the best and the most common means used by the "Devil" to turn away the seeker who has had insufficient warning from the narrow way which leads to Life.  Jesus asked:

        How can ye believe which receive glory from one another, and seek not the glory that comes from God only?

    When we accept the "glory of men," yet still believe that we are on or walking on the Way, we fall directly under the law of equilibrium.  Jesus alluded to this when he quoted the Pharisees who prayed in the streets, saying that "they have already received their reward."

    It is well understood that the human Personality, in the unfinished state in which we find it, forms our only instrument for esoteric work.  Better still, it is a gift; it is the talent the Master has given us so that we may make it bear fruit.  Woe to the servant who buries it in the earth of his body.  "Cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth."  And here, this is no metaphor. 

    We must therefore work with love and with all our strength since we do not know at what hour the Master will come.

     This being so, the attitude of the esoteric Doctrine towards lying is clear  and realistic.  ...We must fight energetically against .. useless lies.

    It is only by training of this nature that we shall progressively be able to  master the rooted tendency to lie which exists within us.  Every attempt to  hurry things, so far as lying to others is concerned, though it be a noble  attempt, is doomed to early failure.  We live in a world which is immersed in  lies and moved by lies.

    It is also necessary to guard against a variant of the habit of lying to  ourselves, one which we commonly adopt from early childhood, and against which  we must fight by every means.  This variant is widespread because at first  glance it appears to us to be a positive attitude.  ...When applied to  ourselves and for our own benefit, with the aim of softening a shock, or  regaining our inner peace after we have sinned, or excusing our actions or  faults, this idiom crystallizes within us over a period of time an auto- tranquilizing mechanism.  ...It is a true mechanism of mental anesthesia,  founded on a refined and disguised lie.  It sows hypocrisy in man towards  himself.

    This auto-tranquillizer must be destroyed."

But we see so often how desperately people want to be "tranquilize."  How  many individuals have written to us asking for an answer that would help  them feel peaceful and enable them to go to sleep at night.  They want  "positive messages."  They want a program of meditation that will make them  feel good, or something to do or "look forward to" that will ease their anxiety  when they glimpse, momentarily, the reality of the Matrix.  They want to feel  chosen and special by virtue of having been "contacted" and performing rituals without doing the absolutely agonizing work necessary to precipitate transformation.

Mouravieff continues:

    The permanent link which must be introduced between the Personality and the  real "I" is esoteric Knowledge.  The knowledge and understanding that it  permits us to acquire represent the philosopher's stone of the medieval  mystics.  They are capable of provoking in man the transmutation to which he  aspires.

    We must work ceaselessly, for fear of not succeeding in time.  One must work,  says Jesus,  "while it is day: the night comes when no man can work."

These commentaries of Mouravieff are absolutely invaluable, and would be helpful to every seeker on the path and reader of the Cassiopaean Material.  This is especially so because Mouravieff actually describes  things that  we have already experienced, even though we did not precisely  understand what it was we were doing, how or even why.

For example,  Mouravieff calls the influences of the material world, the Matrix, the  predator's mind, etc, the "A influences."  (He has diagrams showing how they  affect the consciousness.)  The influences of the esoteric center, the "real  world" concealed by the "matrix illusion," the "truth," are called "B  influences." 

He writes:

    If a man spends his life without distinguishing between "A" and "B"  influences, he will end as he started, one could say mechanically, driven by  the Law of Accident.  ...He can have a brilliant career in the meaning the  world gives to this expression.  Yet he will come to the end of his days  without having either learned or understood anything of the Reality.  And dust  returns to dust.

    In life, every being is subjected to a sort of competitive test.  If he  discerns the existence of the "B" influences; if he acquires a taste for  gathering and absorbing them; if he continually aspires to assimilate them  better; his mixed inner nature will slowly undergo a certain kind of evolution.

    And if the efforts which he makes to absorb the "B" influences are constant  and sufficient in force, a magnetic centre can be formed within him. 

    If this center once born in him is carefully developed, it takes form, and in  its turn will exercise an influence over the results of the "A" influences  which are always active, deflecting them.

    Such deflection may be violent.  In general it transgresses the laws of  exterior life and provokes many conflicts in and around man.  If he loses the  battle, he emerges with the conviction the the "B" influences are nothing but  illusion: that the only reality is represented by the "A" influences.  Slowly,  the magnetic center which had been formed within him is reabsorbed and  vanishes.  Then, from the esoteric point of view, his situation is worse than  the one he had started with, when he was just beginning to discern "B"  influences.

    But, if he emerges a winner in this FIRST struggle, his magnetic centre,  consolidated and reinforced, will draw him to a man having a "C" influence  stronger than his own, and possessing a stronger magnetic center.  And so on in  succession, the last man being in connection with another having in influence  "D", who will be his link with the Esoteric Center "E."

    Henceforth in life, that man will no longer be isolated. 

    To the measure of its growth, the man will escape the dominion of the law of  accident and enter the domain of consciousness.

Mouravieff then shows a diagram of the person who deludes himself and does not  struggle against the lies of the Matrix... who has not engaged in the work of  stripping away lies:

    This second figure, with black magnetic centers, represents the situation  where man deludes himself and, believing he is absorbing "B" influences and  making the necessary selection all the while, he in fact absorbs "A"  influences... This will put him into contact with people who possess magnetic  centers of the same nature: who are themselves duped or who dupe others, and  who have no direct or indirect link with the esoteric Center.

In both the Wave Series and the Adventure Series, we have been dealing with identifying these very influences and emphasizing the necessity of "collecting" the "A" influences in terms of "seeing the unseen" of what we have called the Theological Reality. We have also met many characters that are aptly described by Mouravieff in his diagram of those individuals who have deluded themselves and have created a magnetic center of negativity, and how they attract to themselves others with similar negative magnetic centers.

In other words, the activities described in the Adventures series - the constant questioning,  stripping, looking at what is difficult and dealing with it - the shocks of  seeing the Matrix, the "man behind the curtain," the effort to "see the unseen"  is the very activity of collecting these "B" influences which then lead to the  "magnetic center," or "lodestar," as the C's called it.

    Q: When I post material on the website, those people who resonate to the material believe that this refers to them also. I have been of the opinion that Unified Thought Form being must mean a very large group as represented in this density. I know that we are dealing with limiting terms. But, is this applied to people who CHOOSE the Cassiopaean option?
    A: Maybe it is best to say it applies to those who recognize the application.
    Q: So, if they recognize it, if they know it is them, they are part of it. (A) But, thinking in nonlinear terms, its up to us to work to make this precise. You are asking this question which implies that the answer exists. But, exactly what the answer is may be it is not yet chosen, and it is up to us to make it this way.
    A: Lodestar is a clue for you.

Mouravieff writes:

    This evolution seems a long process, an uninterrupted combat with a series of  successes and falls.  More than once, he who searches will fall into crises of  discouragement; more than once it will seem to him that he is being driven  beyond the limits of his own life; he will sometimes feel crushed under the  burden of the tests and difficulties against which he will be pitted during his  search. 

    This can be understood when we know that esoteric science in its teaching goes  far beyond simple information.  Its purpose, in fact, is nothing less than the  TRANSFORMATION of the very being of those who study it...

    In every case where esoteric science offers ALL, it demands ALL in return.  One  must pay all.

    It is impossible to reach the true by the path of lies or hypocritical games,  because in this case we seek to BE, rather than to "appear to be."

Mouravieff describes the reaction of the "matrix/ B influences" to the person  who is on the Path:

    As long as man accepts the principle of the final annihilation of his  Personality without a fight, he can carry on in life without attracting the  increasing pressure of the General Law of Accident upon himself.

    The case is totally different if he struggles to surpass the limits which it  imposes.  He then runs against the action upon him of this Law and its  derivatives.  It acts simultaneously on several planes: physical, mental and  moral.  Its action on the moral plane is conceived by man, since time  immemorial, in the form of the personification: the Devil."

We are also reminded of Gurdjieff's remarks about the "mechanical force"  having promoters and adherents at very high levels who act under its powerful  influences.  We suggest that both are 4 and 5 D STS beings.

    ...Once the first positive results are obtained those students will  unmistakable run up against the active opposition of the law and the "game of  the Crafty One."

    It must be realized that in placing himself under the aegis of the Law of  Exception, man goes against the General Law of Accident, which he is even   called upon to overthrow, if only on the individual scale.  He must no forget -  under penalty of "surprise attack" - that salvation depends on victory over the  Devil, which, as we have said, is the personalized moral aspect of the General  Law of Accident.  This is so even though this, being a cosmic law, is naturally  a divine law. 

    One must not be afraid, as the Law of Exception is also a divine law.

    In choosing it, man continues to serve the interest of the whole, but  differently and in an incomparably more efficient manner.

    During his fight against the first law, he is subject to tests that often take  the form of temptations.  ...We are permitted to draw attention to the indirect  nature of diabolical action.

    If, aiming straight towards his goal, which is liberation and salvation, the  seeker successfully overcomes the obstacles and by this shows proof of a  strength that would permit him to defy the authority of the General Law, the  latter will begin to act upon him indirectly, generally by the mediation of his  near ones if they do not follow the same path:  this action occurs on the moral  plane, and often takes emotional forms appealing to his most noble, generous  and disinterested sentiments: to his charity; his obligation; his pity.  It  impels him down blind alleys, insinuating that he will thus be returning to his  duty, that by so doing he will go on walking in the right path, etc. 

    This will clarify the profound saying of Jesus that : "A man's worst enemies  are those of his own household."

    Let us repeat:  esoteric work is by its nature a revolutionary work.  The  seeker seeks a change of state: to overcome Death and attain Salvation.  This  is the goal give to this work by the scriptures:  "If ye live after the flesh,  ye must die."

    The man who lives passively under the first law, insensibly and without being  aware of it  - even as an excellent citizen - involves himself in "The broad  way that leadeth to destruction; he who chooses the Law of Exception takes :  "The narrow road that leadeth to life."

Article - Laura Knight-Jadczyk
Commentary on Boris Mouravieff's Gnosis

Boris Mouravieff writes in his book "Gnosis: Study and commentaries on the Esoteric tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy. Book I, Exoteric Cycle"

    Homo Sapiens lives immersed in his everyday life to a point where he forgets himself and forgets where he is going; yet, without feeling it, he knows that death cuts off everything.

    How can we explain that the intellectual who has made marvelous discoveries and the technocrat who has exploited them have left outside the field of their investigations the ending of our lives? How can we explain that a science which attempts everything and claims everything nevertheless remains indifferent to the enigma revealed by the question of death? How can we explain why Science, instead of uniting its efforts with its older sister religion to resolve the problems of Being - which is also the problem of death - has in fact opposed her?

    Whether a man dies in bed or aboard an interplanetary ship, the human condition has not changed in the slightest.

    Happiness? But we are taught that happiness lasts only as long as the Illusion lasts... and what is this Illusion? Nobody knows. But it submerges us.

    If we only knew what Illusion is, we would then know the opposite: what Truth is. This Truth would liberate us from slavery.

This last remark seems to me to be important. Very often people write to me and say that the C's material is too "scary" and that we talk too much about the "illusion" why aren't we talking about positive things or concentrating on "escaping" or whatever.

Well, the fact seems to be that what Mouravieff has said above is the key: If we cannot map the illusion, we have no hope of getting out of it. It is in mapping the illusion that we are able to distinguish between what Mouravieff calls the "A" influences and the "B" influences. We call it seeing the Theological Reality behind the Matrix. Mouravieff points out that the more we "collect" or "perceive" the "B" influences, and act on them, the more we "magnetize." And naturally, SEEing the "A" influences, or discerning the lies of our reality, consists in an ongoing series of "shocks" that seem to be necessary to change our center of gravity.

When I was spending years struggling my way through this material - in real time - up close and personal, I wailed about it to the C's:

    Q: (L) I want you guys to know that I sometimes feel a wee tiny bit like a pawn on a chessboard!
    A: You should, you inhabit 3rd density STS environment.
    Q: (L) I was at least hoping that if I was a pawn, that some of the players were good guys. Is that asking too much?
    A: Yes.
    Q: (L) To which statement?
    A: Good guys don't play chess.
    Q: (L) But there have been so many strange events, so many synchronous events. Is that the good guys helping or the bad guys leading me astray?
    A: Neither. It is Nature running its course.
    Q: (L) Okay. One of the sensations I have experienced is that I have had it up to the eyebrows with the negative energies and experiences of 3rd density, and I have thought lately that this feeling of having had enough, in an absolute sense, is one of the primary motivators for wanting to find one's way out of this trap we are in. I want out of it. Is this part of this "nature" as you call it?
    A: Yes. [...] When you see the futility of the limitations of 3rd density life, it means you are ready to graduate. Notice those who wallow in it.
    Q: (L) Some people obviously wallow in extreme materiality. And there seems to be another kind that is more subtle, which has to do with saying that you want to grow and become enlightened, and yet such a person is unable to pierce the veil of their own illusions about how to become enlightened, and this illusion is the wallowing...
    A: Wallowing takes many forms.

    Q: (L) Well, you say that, but it is, as several people have pointed out to me, only since we have begun this channeling project that all these dreadful things have happened in my life. My life is a shambles!
    A: "Dreadful is subjective."
    Q: (L) I would say that the physical things that have happened to me, the collapse of my marriage, the things that have happened to my children, are pretty damn dreadful, subjectively or otherwise!
    A: Before these changes began to manifest, you were deeper into the "deadly illusion" than you are now. Emergence is, by its very nature, uncomfortable. But, it has and will, empower you, we promise!!!!!!!!
    Q: (L) It is a very trying time now. I am having a difficult time just coping.
    A: And there have been others, and will be others, but that does not mean that the rewards will be slight.
    Q: (L) Well...
    A: You are on a path of destiny, and there is no turning back now.

    Q: (L) This recent 'awakening' or period of seeing things with such clarity, as they really were, and the whole picture of the interactions between people and how truly ugly it can be. I plunged into a terrible depression. I needed to get my balance from seeing so much all at once. Can you explain to me what was going on?
    A: Growth.
    Q: (L) I tried to share this perception with other people, and almost without exception, when I said to people that I was finally seeing things in their true state and it was NOT a pretty picture, they all said "well, you are obviously seeing this through the eyes of some major spirit possession!" Why would they say this?
    A: First of all, it is not correct to perceive "everything in such darkness and gloom, etc." That is merely the result of a cocoon of falsehood being removed. Celebrate the balance. Don't mourn the death of an illusion of an imbalance.
    Q: (L) Where do I go from here? Where do we all go?
    A: Everywhere.

The point is that it seems that until a person fully SEES the illusion - the layers and layers of it - they have no hope of becoming free of it. Until we are trained, step by step, to discern the lies from the truth, we have no internal consistency and are subject to the whims of the Control System at every turn. And it seems to be that this patient, time-consuming, taking apart of our reality and extracting the Truth/"B" influences is what literally "grows" the soul.

Many people simply can't do it. They can't stand the bloody mess of the birth of the higher self which takes place on the bodies of all the sacred cows that were held so close for so long. They want to hear nice stories about how their breathing and spinning tetrahedrons are going to just fix them right up. They want to hear how the "Guardian Alliance" is going to help us out of the soup. They want to hear how the Zetas are warning us that we are in danger of being smacked by a rogue planet and if we ask real nice, we might get a seat on the airlift out.

As Mouravieff has just said: "If we only knew what Illusion is, we would then know the opposite: what Truth is. This Truth would liberate us from slavery."

And it seems that the only way we have of discovering Truth in this reality, is to first of all strip away all the lies. And Lord! There's a raft of them!

Now, back to Mouravieff:

    What strikes us from the very beginning is that man confuses moral progress with technical progress, so that the development of science continues in dangerous isolation.

    The brilliant progress that has come from technology has changed nothing essential in the human condition, and will change nothing, because it operates only in the field of everyday events. For this reason it touches the inner life of man only superficially. Yet from very ancient times it has been known that the essential is found within man, not outside him.

    Humanity has arrived at an important turning point in its history. The Cartesian spirit which destroyed scholastic philosophy is now in turn being left behind. The logic of history demands a new spirit. The divorce between traditional knowledge, of which religion is a trustee, and acquired knowledge, the fruit of science, threatens to make sterile our civilization.

    Yet it is an aberration to believe that Science by its very nature is opposed to [spirit], and it must also be firmly stressed that [spirit] does not include any tendency opposed to Science. On the contrary, the [mystics] foresaw the prodigious development of Science.

    The celebrated formula of St. Paul: Faith, Hope and Love, summarizes a vast programme of evolution for human knowledge. If we examine this formula in relation to its context we see that the first two terms are temporary, while the third is permanent. [...] It was appropriate to the epoch in which it was expressed, and its significance has had to evolve with time. [...] Science and knowledge are called on to replace Faith and Hope, which defined the limits of what was accessible to the mentality of the epoch when he taught - have since then known extraordinary development.

    He therefore adds: "Now that I have become a man, I have put away childish things."

    This is how the passage from Faith to Knowledge is described. [Faith being appropriate to that time, Science replacing Faith in our time.]

    St. Paul then specifies that this last, although necessary in evolution, is NOT a final state, as it is incomplete by nature. He adds that "When that which is perfect is come, that which is incomplete disappears."

    The perfect is Love, which unites in itself the accomplishment of all virtues, of all prophecies, of all mysteries, and of all Knowledge.

    It is by the joint efforts of traditional science, based on Revelation, and of acquired Science, the domain of positive knowledge, that is, on "Faith and Hope," that one can hope to fulfill the programme traced out by St. Paul, and finally attain Love in its integral meaning."

The work of Mouravieff was only translated into English fairly recently, but Ark read them in French many years ago. He had forgotten much of what was in them because he had to read them with a dictionary and it was a slow and laborious process. But recently, when we found them in English, we ordered them and I have to tell you that reading some of the things in there really amazed me. As the author of the introduction to Mouravieff's books wrote: "It predicts, in what appears at first to be mere theory, the actual events of the life in the study of Gnosis." Mouravieff has certainly written a book that "predicts" much of what we have already experienced in our initiatory path guided by the Cassiopaeans. And this is what encourages us that Mouravieff's text consists of significant chunks of knowledge of a high order.

Indeed, even in reading Mouravieff we must discriminate. But it is apparent that there is information there that can assist the seeker to greater understanding of the process of spiritual transformation.

What struck me most forcibly was the fact that things that we KNOW because of experience, are described and explained by Mouravieff even though the experiences happened for us before reading the explanation. And even though Ark had read these books, those specific things that I want to quote here, had no meaning for him because they were - at the time - outside of his range of experiences.

Mouravieff talks about the degrading of women to "living merchandise" and how Jesus (as a Gnostic teacher) taught "reciprocal choice in love" which established the idea of "romance" between men and women. I have already noted that this seems to be philosophy of the "Golden Age," transmitted down through the ages via Archaic Shamanism, the Eleusinian Rites, and then later the True Teachings of Jesus, not to be confused with the Egyptian mythical overlay that is known as Christianity today.

"Reciprocal choice in love" is certainly a theme of the Grail stories with their emphasis on romance - on "platonic love" and so on - and it has long been a mystery as to what, precisely, this allegory was supposed to convey. If what Mouravieff is saying is true, then it will all begin to make perfect sense, even including the possible survival of the Cathar teachings in the Grail stories and the lays of the minstrels and Troubadours, etc.

Also, there is Fomenko's theory to consider - that much of the "history" of the Dark Ages in Europe is really the history of ancient Byzantium, the origin of the Grail stories, and the "path of transmission" of the ancient Gnostic traditions. That is not to say that we agree completely with what Fomenko has proposed. What is important is that he noticed that something was very strange with history and he sought an explanation. Unfortunately his explanation did not include hyperdimensional manipulations.

And of course, here is where we come to one of the big differences between the work of Gurdjieff and Mouravieff: Sex and sexuality. Gurdjieff's teachings on sexuality were quite different from the teachings of Mouravieff. Gurdjieff had said that there were three "centers" in the human being - (1)Intellectual Center (2)Emotional Center (3) Sex Center. The proper kind of sex, according to Gurdjieff, was when the Sex Center functioned with its own energy without "borrowing" energy from the other two centers. In other words, sex should be separated from the intellectual and emotional life of human beings, and love does not enter into his teachings on sexuality. Homosexuality is said to be incompatible with the Work on Oneself. Mouravieff suggests that when the magnetic center is established, it takes under its control ALL of the centers, including the sexual center.

And here we are not speaking of Tantra, as the reader will discover as we continue with this series of excerpts. However, it seems that the negative occult tradition has sought to promote the idea of Tantric sex as a means of "spiritualization." We believe that this is a complete misunderstanding of the principles.

Mouravieff writes:

    The romance, by which Christian society expressed the principle of reciprocal choice, reached its climax in the Middle Ages. In spite of the decline it has known since then, and in spite of a current tendency to return to regressive forms of relations between the sexes, it still remains the avowed ideal of our society.

    Is it not exact, then, to speak of the death of romance? A revolution is occurring silently which will replace the free romance, distinctive mark of the Christian era, with the singular romance characteristic of the Holy Spirit. Liberated from servitude to procreation, this romance of tomorrow is called on to cement the indissoluble union between two strictly polar beings, a union which will assure their integration in the bosom of the Absolute. As St. Paul says:

        "Nevertheless, neither is the woman without the man, nor man without the woman in the Lord."

    The vision of such a romance has haunted the highest minds for thousands of years. We find it in platonic love, the basis of the singular romance in the myths of Androgyne man; of Orpheus and Eurydice; of Pygmalion and Galatea... This is the aspiration of the human heart, which cries in secrecy because of its great loneliness. This romance forms the essential aim of esoteric work. Here is that love which will unite man to that being who is unique for him, the Sister-Wife, the glory of man, as he will be the glory of God. Having entered into the light of Tabor, no longer two, but one drinking at the fount of true Love, the transfigurer: the conqueror of Death.

    Love is the Alpha and Omega of life. All else has only secondary significance.

    Man is born with the Alpha. It is the intention of the present work to show the path which leads towards the Omega.

    When we ask someone who lives under this constant pressure of contemporary life to turn his mental vision towards himself, he generally answers that he has not enough time left to undertake such practices. ... If he acquiesces, he will in most cases say that he sees nothing: Fog; Obscurity. In less common cases, the observer reports that he perceives something which he cannot define because it changes all the time.

    This last observation is correct. Everything is in fact continually changing within us. A minor external shock, agreeable or disagreeable, happy or unhappy, is sufficient to give our inner content a quite different appearance.

    If we follow up this interior observation, this introspection, without prejudice, we will soon note that our "I" of which we are so consistently proud, is not always the same self: the "I" changes.

    As this impression becomes more defined we begin to become more aware that it is not a single being who lives within us but several, each having his own tastes, his own aspirations, and each trying to attain his own ends.

    If we proceed with this experience, we will soon be able to distinguish three currents with that perpetually moving life: that of the vegetative life of the instincts, so to speak; that of the animal life of the feelings; and lastly that of human life in the proper sense of the term, characterized by thought and speech.

    It is as though there were three beings within us, all entangled together in an extraordinary way.

    So we come to appreciate the value of introspection as a method of practical work which permits us to know ourselves and enter into ourselves.

    The inner content of man is analogous to a vase full of iron filings in a state of mixture as a result of mechanical action. Every shock received by the vase causes displacement of the particles of iron filings. Thus real life remains hidden from the human being due to the constant changes occurring in his inner life.

    Even so, as we shall see later, this senseless and dangerous situation can be modified in a beneficial way. But this requires work; conscientious and sustained effort. Introspection carried out relentlessly results in enhanced internal sensibility. This improved sensibility in its turn intensifies the amplitude and frequency of movement whenever the iron filings are disturbed. As a result, shocks that previously were not noticed will now provoke vivid reactions. These movements, because of their continuous amplification, can create friction between particles of iron so intense that we may one day feel the interior fire igniting within us.

    The fire must not remain a harmless flare-up. Nor is it enough that the fire smolders dormant under the ashes. A live and ardent fire once lit must be carefully kept alight by the will to refine and cultivate sensitiveness. If it continues in this way, our state can change: the heat of the flame will start a process of fusion within us.

Regarding this idea of the internal crucible, the C's have said:

    Q: (A) A related question concerning our internet activities which have been going on for some time, and we do it because we feel that it is necessary, but we don't really know or understand what is the real purpose of what we are doing. Some people are reading our pages and writing letters, and then they disappear or they are discouraged, or they do nothing on their own. We are expending a lot of time on this publishing of information, but without clear understanding of what we are supposed to accomplish by this. (L) At this point, it is not accomplishing a whole lot except drawing down fire on our heads! (A) Right!
    A: You should rejoice! From the fire comes light. Patience pays. You are on the right track.

Back to Mouravieff: 

    ...A live and ardent fire, once lit must be carefully kept alight by the will to refine and cultivate sensitiveness. If it continues in this way, our state can change: the heat of the flame will start a process of fusion within us.

    From this point on the inner content will no longer behave like a heap of iron filings: it will form a block. Then further shocks will no longer provoke interior change in man as they did previously. Having reached this point he will have acquired a firmness; he will remain himself in the midst of the tempests to which life may expose him.

    To reach this state, we must from the beginning rid ourselves of all illusions about ourselves, no matter how dearly held; an illusion - if it is tolerated at the start - will grow en route, so that suffering and additional effort will be necessary in order to rid ourselves of it at a later date.

    As long as man has not reached the point of fusion, his life will be in effect a factitious existence, as he himself will change from moment to moment. Since these changes will occur as a result of external shocks which he can almost never foresee, it will also be impossible for him to predict in advance the exact way he will change internally. thus he will live subject to events as they occur, always preoccupied by constantly "patching up". He will in fact progress toward the unknown, at the mercy of chance. This state of things is the principal law under whose authority he leads his illusory existence.

    Esoteric science indicates the possibilities and the means of freeing oneself from this law.

    But to begin effectively in this way, one must first clearly see the situation as it is.

The parable of the coach:

    The physical body is represented by the coach itself; the horses represent sensations, feelings and passions; the coachman is the ensemble of the intellectual faculties including reason; the person sitting in the coach is the master.

    In its normal state, the whole system is in a perfect state of operation: the coachman holds the reins firmly in his hands and drives the horses in the direction indicated by the master.

    This, however, is not how things happen [due, the C's say, to DNA modification]

    First of all, the master is absent. The coach must go and find him, and must then await his pleasure. All is in a bad state: the axles are not greased and they grate; the wheels are badly fixed; the shaft dangles dangerously; the horses, although of noble race, are dirty and ill-fed; the harness is worn and the reins are not strong. The coachman is asleep: his hands have slipped to his knees and hardly hold the reins, which can fall from them at any moment.

    The coach nevertheless continues to move forward, but does so in a way which presages no happiness. Abandoning the road, it is rolling down the slope in such a way that the coach is now pushing the horses, which are unable to hold it back. The coachman, fallen into a deep sleep, is swaying in his seat at risk of falling off. Obviously a sad fate awaits such a coach.

    This image provides a highly appropriate analogy for the condition of most human beings...

    Salvation may however present itself. Another coachman, this one quite awake, may pass by the same route and observe the coach in its sad situation. ... He may perhaps stop to help the coach that is in distress. He will first help the horses hold back the coach from slipping down the slope. Then he will awaken the sleeping driver and together with him will try to bring the coach back to the road.

    He will lend fodder and money. He might also give advice on the care of the horses, the address of an inn and a coach repairer, and indicate the proper route to follow.

    It will be up to the assisted coachman afterward to profit, by his own efforts, from the help and the information received. It will be incumbent on him from this point on to put all things in order and, open eyed, to follow the path.

    He will above all fight against sleep, for if he falls asleep again, and if the coach leaves the road again and again finds itself in the same danger, he cannot hope that chance will smile upon him a second time; that another coachman will pass at that moment and at that place and come to his aid once again.

    [...] Man reacts as much as possible against this constant pressure of the difficulties and obligations which weigh him down. As for the changes within him, he generally compensates for this by instinctive reactions: a fixed attitude to each situation. He wants at all costs at least to appear logical with himself and master of his actions.

    [...] It is because the friction between the particles of iron filings produces a disagreeable sensation in us that we feel the need to get rid of it. The movement of the iron filings stops when we find a solution and so ward off the shocks received. The discovery of a culprit will allow us this relief. As a result man appears to us to be constantly preoccupied with his interior patching up, which in time becomes almost wholly automatic within him.

    [...] There is an urgent necessity that man should become master of himself.

Here we skip a couple hundred pages where Mouravieff brings in some Synarchy stuff under the influence of the negative occult "tradition" which was very active at the time he was writing and has influenced many people to follow the wrong path. Without the C's perspective of 4th density and the principle of the Network, synarchy is just another "elitist hierarchy." Mouravieff and others did not understand the STS vs. STO principles - hierarchies vs. circles, etc - so must be excused for not incorporating these concepts. Nevertheless, his other ideas, drawn from the ancient sources, are remarkable and extremely insightful.

    Troubles and uncertainties are normal during a period of transition. Sunrise is always preceded by an increase in night's chill.

    Today man feels acutely the opposition between the tremendous technical progress and the obvious moral deficiency of humanity. In fact, while life on the material plane is moving at an accelerated pace due to the political, social and industrial Revolution, man has made no marked progress on the moral plane.

    Today, any being who thinks will feel unhappy; if his ability to do is deficient, his overdeveloped sensibility makes his active will all the more exacting and refined. This is so much so, that he sees his good intentions wither before they have had the strength to blossom.

    There is no reason to hope that the present situation will correct itself automatically. On the contrary, the more technical progress accelerates, the wider grows the gulf in modern man between wanting and the ability to do. This contradiction can be seen on every plane. For example, [over fifty years after] the end of the second world war, the world is trapped in a situation which is neither war nor peace. This in itself is an eloquent demonstration of the powerlessness of those in authority.

    ...Man must now discover new sources of moral energy in the same way that he has - thanks to science - found new sources of physical energy.

    [The solution lies in a network of human beings] whose latent moral faculties are developed and cultivated.

    The knowledge and understanding and savior-faire needed to attain this aim have been preserved through the centuries...

    In their ensemble, they form the WAY.

    This is "esoteric Christianity."

    Century after century, while the flame of primitive Christianity burned low, esoteric work has remained vigilant. The esoteric meaning of the work was a preparatory effort: its objective was to accumulate the necessary energies on the astral plane, and so make it easier for humanity to pass through the great turnings of History...

    These changes in direction, and the coming of the new era they imply, have been constantly notable for the varied active and eminent roles played by women....

    The principle of Woman's intervention is found in ALL crucial periods of history.

    Periods where the ennobling role of the woman in the life of human society has faded are marked by a triviality of morals and manners, expressed in particular by a taste for realism carried to its utmost limits.

    Today, human relations suffer from a real distortion in the innate role that woman is destined to play at the side of man: instead of being the active force in these relations, the inspiring and fruitful complement to the man, the woman tends to follow a parallel path, which no longer permits her to exercise her own creative vocation.

    [...] Man and woman once formed a single spiritual being - [even if in separate bodies] - endowed with the unique consciousness of the real Self; The Being described in the myth of the Androgyne.

In the cycle of the "Fall," the male dominator conceptualization, the rule of the Father and the son, human beings became isolated from their real "I." Human beings take the illusions of the "I," the "predator's mind, so to say, as reality.

    The incomplete "I" of the Personality, unfinished and powerless, wanders in life with no faith and no true affection. It goes from error to error, from weakness to weakness, and from lie to lie. A prisoner - perhaps voluntarily - but nevertheless a prisoner - man does not do what he wants to do in life, but does what he hates, blindly obeying a diabolical mechanicalness which, under its three aspects: fear, hunger and sexuality, rules his life.

    This purely factitious existence has nothing real except the possibility of evolution - which remains latent, and forms the objective of esoteric studies and work. Apart from this seed, everything in exterior life is based on lies.

    If the Fall is a direct consequence of identifying with the "I" of personality [the predator's mind, the degraded DNA state], and the solitude of polar beings separated by the Fall is the source of weakness in humans who have in this way become mortal, the return of Unity appears to be an inexhaustible source of new energies. These energies are necessary to man, and to restore the dangerously disturbed equilibrium of today's public and private life, he must seek them out.

    However, this return to the perfect unity of polar beings is not give freely. It is the exclusive privilege of those who have crossed, or are ready to cross, the Second Threshold of the Way.

    It is through realization of the totally indivisible unity of their real "I", by two polar Individualities arrived at the Second Birth, that the original sin can and must be redeemed.

    This is the solution to the problem - the need to find a new source of moral energy. We have reached this solution by means of the positive method of esoteric study.

    Man must link together the work of the intellectual and emotional centers.

    If the question to be studied and solved is of an intellectual nature, then, after the intellectual center has elucidated it, before reaching a conclusion or final decision and before taking action, man must consult his emotional center. Conversely, he must not act impulsively or exclusively under the influence of the emotional center: before acting, he must consult his intellectual center.

    In general, man must cultivate in himself the ability to grasp any phenomenon and any problem - in the inner and outer worlds - by simultaneously using the two centers - emotional and intellectual.

    ***

    The natural growth of the Personality stops long before it is complete. It has an individual limit which depends upon a whole ensemble of factors including: civilization, race, caste, family and social surroundings, education and instruction.

    Without continuous conscious effort, the development of the Personality beyond this limit can never occur. ...To take development further, conscious efforts must be made. The rule is exact: whoever does not develop his talents loses them.

    We generally seek to develop these talents through education. As long as our studies or researches continue, the Personality continues to grow, although often in a not very harmonious way. But when studies and researches end, and we start to exploit the knowledge we have acquired in this routine manner, the development of the Personality ceases.

    The most important and most difficult stage of the Way to pass is the Staircase, also called the path of Access, which leads to the level of man # 4 [the master of the coach.]

    Anyone who seeks to climb this must make this effort the principal aim of his life. From now on, esoteric work must become the axis of his existence, round which the inner and outer circumstances of his life revolve.

    This categorical demand must not frighten us. At the same time, we must realize that the tests begin from the first step of the Staircase.

    To cross the first Threshold, many must undergo the first test successfully without looking back: he must be ablaze with the ardent desire to overcome the entanglement of life in the wilderness, so that he can throw himself into the unknown in a search for a new, reasonable and real life.


On 02-12-97, Ark attended his first session with the C's and the following exchange occurred:

    Q: (A) My first question is: I want to understand what is this "predestined mission," what it consists of?
    A: It consists of following the path that has confronted you.
    Q: (A) Okay...
    A: We do not tell you of your predestined mission, because then it is no longer "predestined." You learn by experience, and as you sense, you are on the threshold of a rather profound experience. [...] We were always most impressed with his skills in this area. Do you remember being caught in a cold rain on the "long walk," and how through your upset, you had an insight that "opened a new door?" We remember 1966 as a turning point. Well, this is another, Arkadiusz, and the emotions feel strangely familiar, but this time you have the aid of others on 3rd density. [...] Before, when fear crept into the picture, you had the wisdom not to "look back," even though you had the temptation to do this. Look what has happened!

    Mouravieff writes: If the desire for transformation has enough vigor and intensity, this will fill the interval between the notes DO and Si, which is the First Threshold - the seeker will then stand with a firm footing on the first step of the Staircase.

The idea of a staircase has been mentioned numerous times by the C's, most notably in the context of my then future relations with Ark:

    Q: (L) Is Ark going to be able to help us with technology, to help other people, or to protect ourselves in some way? In this really bizarre stuff going on on our planet?
    A: Too much, too soon, my dear. Curiosity killed the cat.
    Q: (L) Well, satisfaction brought him back!
    A: Not in this case!!!
    Q: (T) You've got to let this go along. It's picking up momentum every day, it seems. So, just let it roll along and let it see where it goes. (L) All right, lets... (T) He's coming to protect you. That's what he said.
    A: Maybe, but there is so, so, so much more in store than that!!!!!!
    Q: (L) Stop!... Is that an ominous, 'maybe, but there's so, so, so much more in store?' Or is that a positive, there is so, so, so much more in store?
    A: Why would you think it ominous?
    Q: (L) Well I don't know.. because I'm scared of what I don't know! (T) Faith, we're back to faith again.
    A: What have we helped you to discover so far? Would you rather discontinue this operation?
    Q: (L) Oh, hell no! (T) After two years, you know she's always going to ask those kinds of questions!
    A: Not two years, eternity.
    Q: (L) Did I just get zinged? (T) No. No. Mirth! (J) Yes, we haven't had mirth in a while! (T) Just a little mirth there!
    A: We have helped you build your staircase one step at a time. Because you asked for it. And you asked for it because it was your destiny. We have put you in contact with those of rare ability in order for you to be able to communicate with us. Again, because you desired it, in order to realize your path. By now, you should recognize the signs... Those who display thinking patterns which in many ways deviate from that which is considered ordinary. The more unusual, the more telling. They have past lives on 3rd density earth, but not recently, but for this one. And they are not oriented to the earth frequency vibrations. [Group discussion ensued on the last response]
    Q: (T) ...It is destiny for you to find out what your path was, you had to make this contact, because it was what you were supposed to do. (L) Are we not talking about Freddie in terms of being put in contact with someone who enables me to communicate with you, so you can put me on my path, which is building the staircase, etc, etc. ? Is that not what we've got going here?
    A: He is one, but not the only one, just the one who awakened your sense of recognition.
    Q: (L) I know this is probably not the time to ask this question; this is the kind of discover, open find out, open that kind of thing, but it seems to me almost that you are leading up to say something, so maybe I can help you along by asking, what is this staircase, what is this destiny?
    A: Discover.

    Mouravieff: The four notes which form the Staircase are linked by a deep interdependence, since their resonance draws its strength from the initial impulse of Desire. This means that if this initial desire does not unite all man's existence in obedience [to the thing desired, i.e. to become free] if it does not dominate his whole being, it is better for him to stop in time and not cross the Threshold.

    We repeat: The Way is a path of no return. This is the real reason for this test of Desire. This Desire must have the strength of Thirst.

But it must be made clear that what Mouravieff means by "desire" is not what is normally meant.

    Cassiopaeans:
    A: "Passion" [in the physical sense] does not set one "free," quite the opposite!
    Q: (L) But what if your passion is for knowledge?
    A: That is not passion, it is soul questing.
    Q: (L) What is it that gives some people this drive, this steamroller effect that they are determined to get to the absolute bottom of everything and strip away every lie until there is nothing left but the naked truth? What is the source of this desire?
    A: Wrong concept. It is simply that one is at that point on the learning cycle. At that point, no drive is needed.
    Q: (L) So, you more or less are there because some critical mass has been reached that 'jumps' you to the point where seeking truth is simply who you are? It defines the parameters of your being.

    Mouravieff: The first step leads to the test of Faith. To Believe is not enough; one must have faith. Here we not that we are not talking about faith or belief in some outside source, but in the self. Here the seeker must surmount his fear of abandonment. Many trials and troubles will face the seeker... all designed to destroy his faith in his own ability to be and to succeed in finding the life that is not materially evident but is only a dream...

        Be not therefore anxious saying, what shall we eat? Or What shall we drink? or Wherewithal shall we be clothed? Your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. but seek ye first the Kingdom of God and His truth; and all these things shall be added unto you.

    The second step is a test of Strength.

    The third step is the test of Discernment and Skill. He who can see and understand the precept "you cannot serve God and Mammon" will be better prepared to withstand this test.

    The fourth step is the test of Love, or true, life-giving love, a consuming fire quite different from what now smolders under the ashes. It is a blazing sword whose flames burn up all alloy mixtures; all that man takes for love - within him or towards him - when it is not that. If we keep these words before our minds, we will immediately be able to judge every movement of the heart, and will know whether or not it contains traces of true Love.

    ***

    To live in the True, with all lies excluded, is the prerogative of the Cycle of the Spirit: Light without shadow.

    We speak here about certain human beings who have attained or who are about to attain the Second Birth. The text leaves no room for ambiguity:

        Lie not to one another: seeing that you have put off the old man with his doings and have put on the new man, that is being renewed until the knowledge after the image of God: where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave and freeman; but Christ is all and in all.

    This is only addressed to those who are on the Way in their relations between themselves.

    He who reaches Love would not know how to lie. But to triumph over lies requires an esoteric culture which is inaccessible to ordinary man.

    This highlights the important problem of lying.

    The struggle against lying is long and drawn out. It is first of all a struggle against ourselves, against our spontaneous tendencies, and against that mechanicalness that makes us revert constantly to lying.

    Useless lies to others are far less harmful than lying to oneself - and easier to master and heal. Lying to oneself sometimes takes on finely shaded forms that necessitate total and sustained attention, together with methodical and persistent efforts.

    to eliminate useless lying to others does not demand continual effort: one must simply watch to see that it does not slip into conversation. At the moment when it is on our lips a simple effort of attention is sufficient to stop it. That is why in struggling for truth, it is recommended to begin with this type of lie.

    But, we easily understand that lying to oneself, or the struggle against this kind of lie, is not perceptible from the exterior.

    When we stop lying uselessly, this will also be unnoticed by those around us. One can say that in practice, the struggle against these two categories of lies does not alter man's relations with other men in any way, although it is very effective for the person who undertakes it. We can therefore begin it without delay, as long as we do it discreetly so as not to draw attention to ourselves, and so do not provoke increasing pressure from the General Law [of accident and mechanicalness which will try to circumvent these efforts; i.e. The Predator's mind/Matrix.]

    [...] As for efforts at suppressing lies to oneself, they entail quite different and important consequences. Such lies grow deep roots. In this domain, paradoxical situations sometimes arise, some of them of such psychological subtlety that it is difficult to draw them out of the shade.

    Here we must mention the question of marriages where one of the partners, having realized that this union is an error, persists in trying to convince him or herself of the contrary. If he is of an affectionate nature, he will redouble his amiability towards his partner as if truly toward his polar "other." The absurdity of the situation reaches its limits if the other partner reacts by adopting a corresponding attitude - without any sincere or spontaneous glow of tenderness.

    The danger from the esoteric point of view is that, by mere force of habit, such a situation takes on for one of the partners, or even for both of them, the value of true love. this kind of lying to oneself can go on for dozens of years with people who are amiable and of good faith, and they entail tragic disillusions in the end.

    The man who starts to struggle against lying to himself must be forewarned of these difficulties, and of the possible collapse of some or all his greatest values.

    All should know that true esoteric work only begins after the individual has passed through a general bankruptcy and has had his gods helplessly thrown to the ground.

    We have indicated the absolute necessity for anyone who aspires to esoteric development to cure himself as soon as possible of this deep-rooted habit of lying to himself.

    We shall now look at this problem from another angle: that of the objective results which man obtains when he is able to stop lying.

    This work takes time, demands the courage to face disillusion, and needs self-confidence and faith in the self. As the seeker advances, he feels a new sentiment.

    He will sometimes feel bitter regret as his beautiful dreams vanish, but at the same time he will feel himself more and more liberated.

    His growing sincerity towards himself will establish an atmosphere of truth in his inner life. The law proclaimed "you shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free" will apply to him in its fullness.

    The word "free" was deliberately chosen to contrast a state of slavery.

    After each operation of inner purification, painful though it may be, the seeker will feel more and more fully a profound gratitude for being freed from this absurd slavery.

    Having reached a certain stage in internal liberation, the individual will understand the full value of the magical power expressed in the word Freedom.

    The acquisition of Inner Freedom is the sine qua non condition of further success in esoteric work.

    This elimination of lying to the self enables one to observe the work of the lower centers in the self objectively. This observation is commenced from this "command post" of impartial observation and judgment of the individual who has overcome the lies to the self.

    When our interior world is thus purified by these rays of the "B", when we have ceased to lie to ourselves, how then are we to act towards others?

    This problem is far from easy.

    It is written: "the kingdom of heaven is forced, and it is the violent men who hold it."

    If we remember that the kingdom of heaven is within, and NOT outside us, then we begin to understand that some force or even violence must be employed INTERNALLY to retake our own fortress.

    This is very often necessary to eliminate the roots of Illusion within us, the mother of lies to ourselves.

    Thus we see that the test at the fourth step is decisive. Until lying stops, man drags along the defects of his past: lying, weakness, self-pity, inner compromise.

    Generally, it takes time, the opportunity and the possibility to rid himself of his baggage before committing himself to the fourth step is met. Many individuals, because of the weight of their past, waste time and allow many opportunities which present themselves to go by.

    But, on the fourth step, the balance sheet must be drawn up and accounts settled. Man, poor and naked, is accepted at the second Threshold, but only on condition that he is consistent and pure.

    The essential is that he be consistent, meaning that he contains within himself true Love, which can only be revealed by the cessation of lying to the self.

    Everything false within him will be burned by the flames of this blazing sword.

    All of these steps happen more or less together in many combinations. They are distributed unequally according to different personalities, and driven by the force of our Desire to be free.

    In stepping onto the Staircase, to approach and then cross the Second Threshold, man adopts a new attitude towards himself: from this point on, he takes his fate in his own hands.

    During later development, the Individuality becomes progressively integrated with the higher cosmos.

    Cassiopaeans:
    Q: (L) Let me ask this one before the tape runs out and we take a break. What is the "ultimate secret" being protected by the Consortium?
    A: You are not in control of yourselves, you are an experiment. [...]
    Q: (L) Yes. Okay. How "long", and I put long in quotes, because we know, as you say, there is no time, but how long, as we measure it, have the Grays been interacting with our race? The Grays, not the Lizards, the Grays, the cybergenetic probes?
    A: No.
    Q: (L) What do you mean, "No"?
    A: Time travelers, therefore, "Time is ongoing."
    Q: (L) Okay, recently I read a couple of books Jan gave me, "Knight in Shining Armor" and "Replay". Both of these books described time travel.
    A: No, not finished with answer. Do you understand the gravity of last response?
    Q: (L) They are time travelers, they can move forward and backward in time, they can play games with our heads... (T) They can set up the past to create a future they want. (D) They can organize things so that they can create the energy that they need... (L) They can also make things look good, make them feel good, make them seem good, they can make you have an idea one minute, and then the next minute, create some sort of situation that confirms that idea...
    A: When you asked how long, of course it is totally unlimited, is it not?
    Q: (L) That's not good. If they were to move back through space time and alter an event in our past, would that alteration in the past instantaneously alter our present as well?
    A: Has over and over and over.
    Q: (D) So they do it over and over and over, constantly? (L) So, at each...
    A: You just are not yet aware, and have no idea of the ramifications!!!
    Q: (L) We're getting a little glimmer! Yeah, I do, a little! (T) The ramifications of being able to move in and out of time and manipulate it the way you want (Jan/Laura) And the ramifications of what they're doing to us; what they are doing to us and what they will do to us, over and over. (Freddy) What did it say about over and over? (L) So, in other words, our only real prayer in this whole damn situation is to get out of this density level. That's what they're saying, that's what it sounds like to me.
    A: Close.
    Q: (L) Because, otherwise, we're just literally, as in that book, stuck in the replay over and over and over, and the Holocaust could happen over and over, and we could just, you know... Genghis Khan, Attila the Hun... over and over and over again. (T) We're stuck in a time loop; they're putting us in a time loop. (J) Are we in a time loop?
    A: Yes.
    Q: (D) I have a question about... there was a... (PAUSE) Mankind has found it necessary for some reason or other to appoint time for some reason or other. The only reason I can see is to have a means of telling, like in verbal or written communications...
    A: Control mechanism.
    Q: (T) Is there a way for us to break the control mechanism? Besides moving to 4th density? (D) That was part...
    A: Nope.
    Q: (D) When 4th density beings communicate it's telepathic, right?
    A: Yes.
    Q: (D) Okay, since time doesn't exist, how do you communicate about happenings?
    A: Rephrase, please; clarify.
    Q: (L) What she means to ask is, if you're communicating telepathically... (D) On 4th density.. (L) And time doesn't exist, how do you communicate about events as one happens now, as opposed to later and the next thing happens, and the next thing happens... (J) How is it sequential?
    A: Translate.
    Q: (D) Translate? Okay, let me explain what I mean. I mean, we talk about 1907 something happened...
    A: That is how it is done.
    Q: (T) Translate is how it is done. You translate the experience?
    A: From 4 to 3. And vice versa.
    Q: (L) So, in other words, it's almost like making movies. (J) Are linear thought processes part of it? Is it being linear and non-linear?
    A: Part of 3d illusion only.
    Q: (L) So, in other words, if you're a 4th density being, everything is more or less happening, excuse the term happening, everything is simultaneous, and if you wish to discuss or communicate or have any focus upon any particular aspect of this unified dimension, then what you do is you kind of extract it out, project it into 3d...
    A: Close.
    Q: (L) ... like a movie.
    A: But you will not understand fully until you get there

    Mouravieff: The life of man is a film. It is certainly difficult for our Cartesian minds to grasp this concept. Our three-dimensional minds are badly adapted to ideas and facts which touch on the domain of the eternal.

    Incomprehensible as it may seem, our life is truly a film produced in accordance with a script. This film goes on continuously, without ever stopping, in such a way that, at the time of his death, man is born again. What seems absurd is that he is born in the same place, at the same date where he was born before, and of the same parents. So the film goes on again. Each human being, then, is born with his own particular film. this represents the field of action in which man is called to apply his conscious efforts.

    The repetition of the film is not reincarnation, although these two notions are often confused. Exterior man, who lives in the system of the Future-Past cannot embrace in a single moment the ensemble of his film, nor even the part that contains his immediate future. To do so, he would need to enlarge the slot of his Present.

    It thus happens to him that, faced with certain events, he will feel that he has already seen or lived those events. Some see in such phenomena the proof of so called reincarnation. In reality, phenomena of this sort are the result of a casual and temporary surge of fine energies in the organism: the slot of the individual Present then enlarges for a few moment, and some significant facts of the immediate future slip into the waking consciousness. In this way, the impression is created of a return of another time. In a certain way this is true, although the impression of having lived before is only caused by mechanical unfolding of the film.

    By reincarnation, we must understand a phenomenon of a very different order. Although the theoretical film revolves integrally on the plane of possibilities, meaning in eternity, the film of the exterior man clings to the plane of realization, that is, of Time, but only to the extent strictly necessary to satisfy the ends of the Ray of Creation.

    True reincarnation, on the other hand, occurs entirely in time, and belongs integrally to the domain of the Real, well understood as part of the broader frame of Manifestation. The human personality is not a reality in the proper sense of the word, but a possibility. It plays a role in the film to which it is attached, from which it will not disappear until the moment of the Second Birth. At that moment, it will cease to be a Personality. Because of its indestructible union with the real "I", it will be transfigured, and so it will become an Individuality. As long as man lives in the wilderness, self-satisfied and immersed in lies and illusions, the film will unfold with mechanical inflexibility, and the Personality will remain entirely unchanged.

    These circumstances start to change the moment man crossed the first Threshold. This passage can be compared to the conception of the future Individuality. The Staircase symbolizes the period of gestation, and the crossing of the second Threshold represents the second Birth, the birth of Individuality. As man becomes more and more integrated with his "I", growing his Individuality, he becomes progressively integrated with the Cosmos and acquires "gifts" appropriate to his individual nature. Simultaneously, he progressively participates in real, objective existence, which finally characterizes his being.

    This is liberation from the bonds of the film.

    It is only at this point of evolution that true individual reincarnation becomes possible.

    True reincarnation is not mechanical; it is done consciously, generally to accomplish a mission.

    Cassiopaeans:
    Q: (LC) Well, if that's the case! I want to ask about past life relations between us. I'm sure there is.
    A: Be specific.
    Q: (LC) Are there any specific past life connections between any of the women in this room?
    A: Who?
    Q: (LC) Well, let's start with Laura. Do I have a past life connection with Laura?
    A: Before we answer that, we wish to hear from you what you perceive a past life circumstance to be.
    [..] How do you perceive the reincarnation process to be?
    Q: (LC) I perceive it as you come back with people you choose to come back with, and that you choose people that you are karmically connected to. (I) I see it a little bit differently than that...
    A: Aha! We have a variance!
    Q: (I) I think that when we die and go to 5th density, that we make pacts with people in each incarnation, so when you come back, it is coming back to fulfill that pact. (LC) Yes, that is the way my line of thinking is going. But, when they asked that question, I was thinking that you have people you come back with because of closeness. Somebody may be your mother in one life, and there is a love bond, and then there are other people that you come back with because you have to resolve something to let go of that person rather than to get closer.
    A: This is partially correct. But, there is more to it than this. For example, one can incarnate on various planes of existence, not just the one you perceive currently. And, one may actually reincarnate on more than one plane concurrently, if one is advanced enough to do this.
    Q: (L) Are you suggesting that ...
    A: Yes, we are!
    Q: (L) I was thinking it, but they didn't let me finish. For the record, I was thinking that we are all part of the same soul unit here.
    A: To an extent, but you may not yet understand what exactly a "soul unit" is in that sense. And of course, there is more than one sense for this as well. The "trick" that 3rd density STS life forms will learn, either prior to transition to 4th density, or at the exact juncture, is to think in absolutely limitless terms. The first and most solid step in this process is to not anticipate at all. This is most difficult for you. We understand this, but this as also why we keep reiterating this point. For example, imagine if one of your past lives is also a future life? [...]
    Q: (P) Now, I just want to say that I think that we have all of us here traveled back in time to change the way things are now. We inserted ourselves into this time period to wake up and see what is really happening. This is 3rd density thinking, I know, but it is the only way I can describe it. We looked back on the way things happened, the way the world is now, and we have come back to change things. We have come from the future, to wake up now, because we didn't wake up before. (C) Maybe that's our "past life/future life" connection here? (P) Right, we all agreed to insert ourselves in this time line.... (L) So, we ARE from the future... (P) Because the world is going in this direction, and SOMETHING had to be done. That's what I see. (I) Yes. We all decided to come back, but there was a strong possibility that we would not be able to wake up and link up. And that's why so many things happened to attempt to keep us from getting together. (P) Not just that, things happen to keep us from waking up period! We've all been bombarded with stuff all our lives. (I) Yes, and when we started waking up, and realized that we HAD to come together to "link" to DO whatever it is we are going to do, there has to be all kinds of things to prevent it even! [Laughter] (S) I would like to ask a question about synchronicity...
    A: Wait a minute... someone said something a short while ago that is surprisingly close to the truth. Now just a moment... reflect please.
    Q: (L) P*** was saying that we have come back from the future and inserted ourselves into this timeline...
    A: Yes. That is close to being totally correct!
    Q: (L) In terms of reincarnation, that we were talking about a few minutes before that, we are possibly incarnations of ourselves incarnated at different levels. This just happens to be one of the levels of reality that we are occupying, but there are other selves at other levels thinking and doing other level stuff, and these other levels are perceived by us as the future...
    A: Maybe for some of you, but let us not get ahead of ourselves.
    Q: (P) The C's say that they are US in the future. So, we, being THEM in the future, some of who they are in the future, have come back as us, to do what we are doing, to undo what is happening on Earth...
    A: Close, but more complex than that. It would be difficult for you to completely understand at this point, but let us just say that you are close.

    Mouravieff: It is important to grasp clearly the difference which exists between the film, a mixture of possibilities, and reincarnation in time, which belongs to the domain of the Real, and to understand the meaning of this difference.

    At the time of the second Birth, that is to say, by crossing the Second Threshold, man escapes his bondage to the film, and enters the domain of redemption. He is then admitted into the sacred brotherhood of living Beings. These beings are an unshakable force: those who are part of it are no longer subject to illness or sorrow. Death loses its hold over them. They have overcome the world.

    In theory, the film in which man is born and in which he lives can go on until the end of the world, on condition that he is happy, satisfied with himself, attributing his virtues to himself, and blaming others for his mistakes and misfortunes. Properly speaking, this kind of existence cannot be considered as human; it could be described as anthropoid. This term is justified in the sense that exterior man, immersed in self-satisfaction, represents the crowning achievement of millions of years of evolution of the species from its animal ancestors, yet from the point of view of esoteric evolution, he is a possibility which has not yet been realized.

    If we envisage the problem of esoteric evolution from the point of view of the film and the different parts man can play in it, it is clear that this kind of evolution is impossible as long as the film can always be considered as turning in the same circle. People who perform in such a film are those we have called anthropoids, puppets, the dead who, in the words of Jesus, "believe themselves to be alive."

    Esoteric evolution starts when man, by his conscious efforts, proves capable of breaking the circle and transforming it into an ascending spiral. The spiral represents an intermediate state between the position where the human Personality is found to be trapped in the film, which revolves mechanically in a way hardly separated from the eternal plane, and that of the perfect, free Individuality, who is able, if need arises, to reincarnate consciously in Time.

    This is an intermediate state in this sense, that the film definitely departs from the plane of the eternal, from the plane of possibilities. The curve of life, which for exterior man does not in practice differ from a circle, transforms itself into a spiral and does not end - as it did previously - almost at its point of departure: the distance between these two points now marks a definite progression in Time.

    The film in the form of a spiral belongs to human beings who climb the staircase. Complete disengagement of the film is produced at the moment of crossing the second threshold. If man is able to do that successfully during a single life, so breaking the circle for the very first time, he does not return to it. Such a case is very rare: it is the lot of the just.

    Generally, this liberation requires several lives; several revolutions of the spiral. As a general rule, each revolution occurs in Time, and consequently can appear to be a reincarnation. In reality, it is nothing but a return to exterior life. A pseudo-reincarnation like this is neither conscious nor personal: it is the actors in the film who return, and they do not remember any previous experiences.

    However, a change is possible as soon as the conscious efforts of man increase the effect of the Time factor by enlarging perception of the Present. In a film which unfolds in a spiral in this way, the contents of the play change; they change in two ways: first in each life, that is, during each revolution, and also from spiral to spiral. The composition of the cast, the circumstances, and the scenery all change. Two elements however remain permanent: first, the general aim, to reach and cross the second Threshold; then the absolute condition for crossing this Threshold, that all the karmic debts which have been accumulated in the present life, as well as during previous spirals, must be neutralized and liquidated.

    Before the Second Threshold, every drama must be played out to its denouement. The work is hard and difficult because man constantly makes mistakes.

    The attentive reader has already understood that following the spiral, or climbing the Staircase, is reserved for human beings who have already absorbed a certain quantity of "B" influences and who thus possess a more or less developed magnetic center. This does not guarantee that they will make no more errors.

    It is true that from the time man first mounts the Staircase he is watched, especially if he makes sincere and considerable efforts. The Esoteric Brotherhood offers him a helping hand. Certain meetings, a play of favorable circumstances, are the forms taken by this help. This assistance does not, however, free him of the need to work on himself and to go on making conscious efforts. In addition, it must be said that often the proffered help is not used, because man does not listen to the advice given, or because he does not grasp the meaning of the favorable circumstances and the possibilities of progress which open before him. He is still more than half a creature of the domain of Illusion, he continues to take frequent impulsive decisions, and often turns against his own avowed aims.

    It must be understood that as long as a man has not attained and crossed the Second Threshold, he will have to start all over again. He will restart every spiral in the wilderness, he will once again have to discern the Cosmic Solar influences, cross the First Threshold, and climb the Staircase step by step. It is true that no conscious effort is ever lost, but the experience acquired in one spiral only appears in the next in the form of innate personal aptitudes, or vague recollections of people in the cast.

    We should know that, at the end of a spiral (incarnation), a comparison is made between the film as it was conceived at the time of birth and what it has become at the time of death. The balance sheet between these two states is drawn up, as in accounting, by listing assets and liabilities, followed by a profit/loss statement. This will show the result of the elapsed life objectively.

    This balance sheet furnishes the basic elements for composing the film at the start of the following spiral.

    If we could avoid all errors and complications in this new experience, produced as a result of free movements, esoteric evolution would then occur in a harmonious rising curve.

    Generally, this is not the case. Man most often comes to this idea of evolution after he has already complicated the film to which he belongs.

    But true evolution cannot occur except on the basis of the original film - after all artificially added elements have been eliminated. The latter is conditional on a return to the PURITY of the centers, especially the emotional center which - at least at the start - is the sole receptacle of Cosmic Solar influences.

    Cassiopaeans:
    Q: (L) Are instincts different from emotions?
    A:Yes.
    Q: (L) How can you tell the difference between instinctive knowledge and emotional reactions?
    A: Emotions involve wishful thinking, instincts are "gut feelings," psychic in nature, and are stronger. When it is wishful thinking, there is always psychic instinct seeping through which you can access if you use reason and examine your lessons of the past.
    Q: (L) Is it also correct that emotion can be used to mislead, that is emotions that are twisted and generated strictly from the flesh or false programming?
    A: Emotion that limits is an impediment to progress. Emotion is also necessary to make progress in 3rd density. It is natural. When you begin to separate limiting emotions based on assumptions from emotions that open one to unlimited possibilities, that means you are preparing for the next density.
    Q: (L) What about Love?
    A: What about it?
    Q: (L) There are many teachings that are promulgated that Love is the key, the answer. They say that illumination and knowledge and what-not can all be achieved through love.
    A: The problem is not the term "love," the problem is the interpretation of the term. Those on third density have a tendency to confuse the issue horribly. After all, they confuse many things as love. When the actual definition of love as you know it is not correct either. It is not necessarily a feeling that one has that can also be interpreted as an emotion, but rather, as we have told you before, the essence of light which is knowledge is love, and this has been corrupted when it is said that love leads to illumination. Love is Light is Knowledge. Love makes no sense when common definitions are used as they are in your environment. To love you must know. And to know is to have light. And to have light is to love. And to have knowledge is to love.

    Mouravieff:
    The heart must therefore be pure, and if not already pure, it must be purified. This is the sine qua non condition of success.

    All the discussion of lying in all its aspects is given to emphasize the absolute need for purifying the heart, and for beginning to re-educate the emotional center in a positive direction. [Remember, the emotions are represented by the horse pulling the coach.]

    This necessity explains the meaning of the words of Jesus: "Except you turn, and become as little children, you shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven."

    This refers specifically to the emotional life. Many have interpreted this as a restriction on the development of the intellect. This is a huge mistake. Intelligence and intellect must be developed and stimulated. The admonition to "become as little children" only points to the need for purity of the centers, NOT the idea of keeping them in a primitive state.

    Paul wrote: Brothers, be not children in that which concerns judgment, be children in what concerns malice, but as to judgment, be fully grown men."

    ***

    It is now time to turn to a possible short cut in esoteric work which can rapidly take us to the second Threshold.

    This is a possibility offered to Polar beings, those couples described by the ancient Tradition in the myth of the Androgyne.

    On the basis of the preceding analysis, the essential data for the film of any ordinary person can be described as follows: as the hero of the romance of his own life, the subject must necessarily be the star of the film.

    But he can also play a minor role in the film of people who play a secondary role in his own film. In this way, each film gets enmeshed with other films, where the same people are found in totally different situations.

    One must also distinguish between two categories of actors.

    The first are really part of the cast. A definite role is assigned to them: they are organically tied to the film.

    The second group only appear by accident in the film, drawn into the action by the free movements of the hero. This complexity is further increased because some of the actors who have genuine parts in the film play their roles badly, while others play roles which are not their own. Situations like this are widespread.

    The human Personality is an organism with multiple parts or facets, 987 to be exact. In the ideal case, only realized by polar beings, and the only effective one from the esoteric point of view, the 987 facets of man and woman are strictly polar. These are the predestined husband and wife whose union will create a true couple.

    However, the cast contains other people, who play roles organically tied to that of the hero, and who are necessary to bring the film in its ensemble to its natural end. these are friend souls, brother souls, sister souls, collaborating souls, servant souls, etc. The Personalities of each of them have a certain number of facts identical to those of the hero, for actors of the same sex, or polar for actors of the opposite sex. In the case of brothers and sisters, the number of identical or polar facets can be as many as half or even more.

    The lack of discernment and of sincerity towards ourselves, the innate desire to find a perfect resonance to the vibration of our soul, and the impatience that follows, all multiplied by the action of the General Law [of accident], induce us too often to contract unions which can only result in absurd situations. Instead of resisting the mirage; instead of waiting and seeking, we slip into imperfect unions, which are a source of suffering both for the partners and their children. In addition, these unions alter the meaning of the film in its ensemble, and so corrupt the personal lives of all the actors in the drama. Lastly, the esoteric results foreseen in the initial composition of the film are gravely compromised.

    It is as a result of considering on the matrimonial plane, or through lack of consideration on the sexual plane, that most of our errors are committed, including those which demand the heaviest payment.

    Even beings of good faith are not exempt from error.

    To confuse a brother or sister soul for husband or wife compounds very complicated situations, especially from the esoteric point of view. The situation is all the more confused when children are born from such unions.

    Life then takes on the character of a perpetual compromise with oneself. the moral and physical health of "accidentally united couples" suffers: with changes in the intellectual center due to cheating and lying; heart disease if the emotional center is sensitive and still aspires to the truth; also diseases of obscure origin, of which cancer is one that attacks the body in its most fragile parts. In every case, the condition necessarily leads to permanent loss of fine energies which, in its turn, brings on accelerated aging and leads to premature death.

    Difficult as are these situations that arise out of our errors, they must not prevent anyone who throws himself into esoteric work from finding the courage in himself to look them in the face and to search for a satisfactory outcome. If the Devil - the General Law - tries to lead us into new errors to obstruct our esoteric evolution, the supporting hand of the Lord is always stretched out to help us. Yet our minds, too rational and too realistic, often stop us from sensing this help.

    When a situation has been entangled by our errors, the Gordian knot must NOT be cut, it must be untied in such a way that the participants, both tied by the same knot, feel only relief at the disappearance of a situation which was simply a source of suffering for both.

    If the situation is resolved, the original meaning of the film and its normal development can be found.

    The ensemble of people organically linked in one film forms a team. In the initial conception of the film, this team must attain a predetermined aim as a result of the way the participants play their roles in the play of life. This esoteric aim is always different from the aims we follow under the influences of the General Law [the Matrix]

    The objective for such a team always has an esoteric meaning in fact, though the Personalities which compose it may be very different. they will share a deep need: a desire to end lies and illusions once and for all, the escape the domination of the [Predator's mind] and, in one form or another, to reach that objective existence in which man finds his real "I" and identifies himself with it.

    Here we must describe the principal law which underlies the formation of these teams. On the material plane, the greatest reward goes to him who commands. On the esoteric plane, the greatest reward goes to him who serves.

    The confusion between these two important master ideas - that of commanding and of serving - sometimes appears dramatic. Even among Jesus' disciples, the question of knowing who was greatest among them tormented them.

    The more evolved the team, the more important the task entrusted to it. History provides examples of the work of teams in all fields. the role of women in teams is particularly marked in crucial periods of the history of peoples.

    [...]Once the First Threshold is crossed, esoteric work will begin to reveal the true meaning of the film. Man must proceed with an impartial analysis of its contents: the role that each of the actors plays in it - and the value of this role - must be passed through a sieve.

    Gradually, as this stripping work progresses, the positive or negative character of different roles emerges more and more clearly. After this, inappropriate elements tend to disappear from the scene.

    At the end of this analysis, the film will contain only a reduced number of actors. but all of them are organically bound together, and with the hero, by the contents of the play, as it was conceived from the beginning of these experiences... which are pursued by the real "I" through centuries or even millennia. The play must then be played out to its resolution or denouement.

    The basic task of man, once he has crossed the first Threshold, is to shelter himself from the karmic influences which are the effects of errors committed in his free movements, either in the present life or in the past. In the past, workers used to go to some monastery or hermitage where they were able to concentrate on introspective work. In the present, our times require energetic and rapid methods.

    Our last question is to examine the method whereby the Staircase between the two Thresholds can be climbed more quickly, while we remain and work in the contemporary world.

    This means exists: it is to work as a couple. However, for this esoteric work to be completed successfully by two people, it is essential that the two beings - man and woman - are integrally polar.

    Cassiopaeans:
    Q: (L) Let me ask a question. Earlier they said something about being on the threshold of an experience. And now they say something is going to unfold in front of you. Are the two response "threshold" and "unfold in front of you," connected?
    A: Of course!!!
    Q: (L) Okay, he is on the threshold of some kind of experience. Is there some way that we might identify this experience? Is it going to be so outstanding that you can't miss it? Or, is it going to be something that you have to pay attention to or you might miss it?
    A: What does "threshold" imply?
    Q: (L) Well, a door. It's a door. Does this mean he is going to go through a door, psychically, spiritually, physically? Going to someone's house?
    A: It does not just imply a "door," but also one's positioning, and a sense of inevitability.
    Q: (L) Is there something I can do to help?
    A: Have you not helped already?
    Q: (L) But, I mean specifically in this "threshold" and "unfolding" experience?
    A: Yes! And, by the way, Arkadiusz, science is most spiritual indeed!
    Q: (L) Well, considering certain other elements, I was just wondering if our pathways are supposed to now be parallel or diverge... how they relate from this point...
    A: Seems to us that your pathways are intertwining!
    Q: (L) The use of the word "intertwining" is curious. You used that in regard to the relationship between EM and gravity. Is there a parallel?
    A: If you wish. [...]
    Q: (L) One last question: you say "combine energies." Is there any reason why this will facilitate the pursuit of answers?
    A: Complementary souls.

    Mouravieff:
    In the "long path," by successive elimination based on long and minute analysis of his film, and after new errors and new failures, man may end by finding his legitimate spouse, a fully integral polar being with whom to unite himself.

    In the "short path", man must begin by a conscious search for his polar being. If found, they can work together on the film which - in its origin - is common to them both.

    A man alone is incomplete. But just where he is weak, his polar being is strong. together, they form an integral being: their union leads to the fusion of their Personalities and a faster crystallization of their complete subtle bodies, united into a common second Birth.

    This is the redemption of "original sin."

    The system of films is conceived in such a way that polar beings will necessarily meet in life, in certain cases more than once. Only the confused ties contracted in this life by each of them, as a result of their free movements, combined with the karmic consequences of one or more previous experiences, can divert the man or woman from the ONLY being with whom they could from a Micro cosmos.

    If there were no karmic debt, everything would go wonderfully: two young people would meet in the most favorable family and social atmosphere, and their union would represent a true fairy-tale. But this is not reality.

    Obeying the principle of Imperfection, and moved by the action of the General Law, the two predestined beings will commit errors. Deeply buried in lies, they do not generally know how to appreciate the gift they are given. Often, they do not even recognize each other.

    If this is the case, then an agonizing question is put: is there one or more means to detect our polar being, and if so, what are these means?

    To meet that person, to do so without recognition, to let our polar being pass by, is the worst mistake we could possibly make: because we would remain in our factitious life, without light.

    Must not everything be sacrificed in favor of a union which is the only chance of our life: the promise of return to paradise lost?

    Nevertheless we should beware of the last trap, one we can fall into just at the moment when ineffable happiness seems to smile upon us.

    We have just said: all must be sacrifices; we have not said: all must be broken.

    If, having recognized one another, the two polar beings triumph over this last ordeal or test, often the most painful, the new life, will open in front of them, as they are then called to be One on earth and in heaven.

    But let us now return to the question of knowing how not to pass by after having met our true alter ago, the pledge of happiness and salvation.

    There is a whole series of subjective and objective clues which assist us in recognizing our polar being. The polarization is manifested on ALL planes simultaneously: sexual, physical, mental and spiritual.

    Two elements must be taken into consideration: If it is correct to say that the predestined man and woman are absolutely polar beings, this polarity is not simple because, to a certain measure, both are physically, mentally and spiritually hermaphroditic beings. That measure, that proportion, is at the same time, sufficient and necessary. It is necessary to permit every being coming into this world to carry within himself the image of the polar being; this image is expressed, in each case, by means of the organ of the opposite sex which exists in every being in a state of non-development. It is, so to say, a part of the flesh and blood of his polar being that each one of us carries within himself. this proportion is sufficient, that is, it is the absolute minimum that will not jeopardize the complete polarity, since the proportion of hermaphroditism in both polar beings is strictly equivalent.

    The second element, which is subjective, is the distortion of our personality due to conscious or unconscious deviations to which the initial film was subject during the course of our existence. Distortions of this kind make it more difficult to recognize the polar being, and can make us less willing to exert ourselves to unite with that being.

    [...] It is the Androgyne who constitutes a true Micro cosmos, not the isolated man or woman. The creation of man in the image and likeness of god was in the form of the Androgyne: this description refers to the joint astral body of two polar beings.

    For man as for woman, salvation in the bosom of the Absolute depends on their reintegration in the Micro cosmos, as Paul indicates explicitly: "neither is the woman without the man, nor the man without the woman in the Lord."

    Man and woman are in fact, incomplete beings who - taken apart - cannot reflect in His fullness the image of God who is all in all.

    it is an axiom that every man and every woman has a polar being.

    Nevertheless, not all human beings feel the imperative need to be united to their polar being. Beings who live enclosed in their Personality without thinking deeply - which constitutes the great majority of humanity - enthusiastically involve themselves in a life ruled by material influences, and do not really feel the need for such a union. For them, the polar being is on the same plane as everyone else. The Personality does not perceive anything exceptional in him, and if by some chance an extraordinary impression is experienced, it is instead felt as something abnormal and embarrassing.

    We can speak of couples formed under the influence of the Law of Accident in which the partners have opposite aspirations. At the base of such unions we often find, beside a double error of judgment, the influences of karmic debt, remote or recent. the most intelligent attitude to take on such occasions is to unite the efforts of the couple to unravel the situation to their mutual benefit. Left to itself, the situation will only get worse.

    Very special care must be taken of the children of such a union, as they suffer within the union. Everything must be done to remedy this. As a general rule, we must not lose sight of the fact that, even if it is permitted to the human being to offer himself in sacrifice, he has no right to accept the sacrifice of others. To sacrifice yourself to a union that is formed under the law of accident only teaches your children to do likewise and hinders their possibilities of ever discovering their own polar being.

    Accelerated evolution of the hero of a film via work on the self - i.e. purification - brings him ever nearer to his polar being. At the same time, it automatically removes from the film those personalities who are not organically integral.

    After the formation of the magnetic center within him, man starts to feel the desire, the need, to be united to his polar being. This desire and need will increase in proportion to the growth of the latter.

    The concept of the Androgyne has purely mythical or theoretical value for ordinary man. But we now realize that a living aspiration to be re-integrated in the Micro cosmos - the most direct way to the re-integration in the Absolute - is the fruit of a high moral culture within the individual.

    As mentioned, esoteric evolution is conditioned at the start by bankruptcy, a moral breakdown. To make progress after this, man must know exactly where he stands. He must SEE himself.

    Isaac the Syrian said that he who has been able to see himself as he IS, is better than he who has seen angels.

    what we call bankruptcy, the ancient traditions call "death." It is death while still in a living body. One must first die, then be resurrected.

     By progressively taking his fate into his own hands, man at the same time takes responsibility for ALL the partners in his film.

    He must restore the original meaning of his film, then push the development of the latter in such a way that the "play" be properly played out to its intended denouement.

    The hero, while working on himself, must apply himself to create new circumstances around him, which will enhance the unfolding of the action towards its originally intended conclusion.

    His exterior efforts must above all be directed towards the creation of these circumstances, NOT towards seeking direct influence over people. Such direct influence over people may seem opportune, but it is an error. Instead of unraveling the situation, the influence creates karmic debts which complicate things all the more. One must be very prudent and circumspect.

    Yet new circumstances must be created in a way that effectively helps those interested to act in the direction desired.

    Once again: man should seek to serve, not to impose himself.

    Patience, perseverance and faith are qualities of great practical value in this work.

    For man to recognize his polar being, he must be fully attentive on all planes accessible to his consciousness. In fact, as a result of the distortion of the film, the meeting always occurs in circumstances and in a manner least expected, generally at a moment and in a form which resembles nothing he could ever have imagined.

    The rule is precise: to recognize his polar being, man must know himself.

    This is obviously logical: to recognize his alter ego, man must first recognize his own ego.

    We are thus confronted once again with the problem of the search for the way.

    It is true that the "I" of the body, like the "I" of the personality, aspire to find the perfect response from another being. This means that ONLY by identifying himself more and more with his REAL "I" that a man magnetizes the union with his polar being.

    It is with a heart full of faith, sharpening within himself his highest faculties of intuition and attention, his sense of critical analysis taken to the highest point of alertness, that man will go in search of the being without whom he is not real.

    As it was for the troubadour long ago, it is in Courtly Love that he can hope to find and recognize "la Dame de ses Pensees."

    The difficulty we find in discovering our polar beings lies in the fact that we are deformed, and constantly distort our film by free movements. We must rectify our own distortion and renounce our impulsive movements. This explains the prescription not to act under the influence of only one center. It is the necessity to correct for our distortion, which, logically, imposes on us the need, both in reception and transmission, for conscious effort to make our emotional and intellectual centers work together.

    When polar beings meet, by what immediately perceptible signs can humans who are still imperfect, still deformed by karmic debt, be certain in all objectivity that they are not making a mistake?

    Here are some indispensable criteria that can have objective value in mutual recognition.

    From the first meeting, in the presence of the polar being, both the "I" of the Personality and the "I" of the body vibrate in a manner which resembles nothing ever felt before.

    The reason for this is that these "I's" find themselves then in the presence of their First Love which continues through the centuries. Without clearly being conscious of it, the polar beings know each other; and this knowledge, as ancient as they are themselves, is expressed by the voice of their subconsciousness. This creates an atmosphere of absolute confidence and SINCERITY from the moment they meet.

    Q: (L) Last Sunday morning, I had a very strange experience similar to what Al-Arabi describes as being in a 'state.' It was like being taken up into a condition of near madness, Ark was there [as in a vision], and then, when [the intensity of the emotion] became unbearable, I deliberately pulled myself back and I was cold, shaking and rocking. I was shivering like I would never get warm and I could FEEL my soul rocking in my body. I would like to know exactly what this was?
    A: Balancing of half-self.
    Q: (L) What is a half-self?
    A: Your starter version, relating to birth karmic imprint.
    Q: (L) What in the world does THAT mean?
    A: What you were assigned with at the onset of this incarnation. What you started with. This must be periodically re-balanced at apex of significant junctures.
    Q: (L) The next thing that happened was that a few days later, I went unconscious and Ark saw me come in the window [5 thousand miles away]. What happened?
    A: Learning is fun!

    Q: As you know, there is a flood in Poland, and Ark has to go back, there is so much that must be done, but the government offices may be closed, the court session may be delayed indefinitely, God knows what is going to happen. What is the source of this dreadful disaster in Poland?
    A: Sopophoric screen alterations of the magnetic belt overlay.
    Q: And what is causing these screen alterations of the magnetic belt overlay?
    A: Influences of Acquiim.
    Q: What is Acquiim?
    A: 4th density overseer.
    Q: Does that mean sporofic screen alteration?
    A: Soporific/phosphorous.
    Q: What is the purpose of this screen alteration?
    A: Deterrence of colinear wave reading consciousness units.
    Q: What is a 'colinear wave reading consciousness unit?'
    A: Suggest you "look in the mirror."
    Q: Well! I don't know if I like being a colinear wave reading consciousness unit!
    A: Why not?
    Q: Because I don't like feeling responsible for all these people who are suffering in this disaster!
    A: Responsible? Are you altering the weather?
    Q: Well, no. But, if they will go to that extent to thwart us, is it safe for him to go back?
    A: If he takes precautions. [...]
    Q: When you said 'colinear wave reading consciousness units,' and 'look in the mirror,' was that a clue that Ark and I are mirror image consciousness units?
    A: Not exactly.
    Q: Well, in a previous session, you said something about being a 'half soul,' and my assumption was that he was a half-soul and I was a half-soul, and together we made a whole soul. But, since that time, I have wondered about this...
    A: No one is unto themselves a half soul.
    Q: Okay, what would give me a more clear understanding about 'half soul balancing?'
    A: The soul as read as a unit of completion. It is the communication which completes the whole in each.
    Q: What are the potentials of colinear wave reading consciousness units?
    A: Specifics.
    Q: Well, if an overseer in 4th density wishes to prevent unification of same, there must be some reason; that there is something that the 4th density STS would not like to see happen. What is it?
    A: Is that not self-evident?
    Q: So, does that mean that it is important for us to be physically together to do whatever this is?
    A: Tis preferable.

    ***

    This is the Touchstone: for polar beings do NOT LIE to each other. They do not need to lie, for inwardly both are one single being, from the depths of which the real "I" issues his call and gives his assent.

This is also true. Ark and I simply find it impossible to lie to each other. Even silly little "avoidances" become like huge barriers and we are compelled from inside to reveal every thought and feeling and idea. And this was true from the very beginning. We knew, somehow, that to lie would be a disaster.

    After this, that absolute, spontaneous sincerity constitutes the basis of their relationship.

    This gives these two beings an otherwise inconceivable feeling of Freedom in Unity, which ends the impression of servitude and isolation under which we ordinarily live.

    Soon afterwards, vague reminiscences of past experiences will start to come to the surface in their waking consciousness.

This was absolutely the case for both Ark and myself. Past life memories literally flooded into our waking and sleeping consciousnesses.

    The reader will now understand the deepest reason why lying to oneself is forbidden: he who lies to himself will also lie to his alter ego. That will be the end of the miracle.

    The wonderful side of the meeting will disappear behind a curtain of trivial lies, which will rapidly take the aspect of an impassable wall.

    This is how and why exterior man passes by his polar being without recognizing her. this is why practical work on the esoteric Way starts and necessarily continues with a struggle against lying to oneself. Success in this field is indispensable.

    To reach this aim, no price whatsoever is too high to pay.

    If they are open to the truth, and if their meeting makes chords - silent until now - vibrate in harmony within them both, the way is then marked out, for polar beings, by their conscious efforts to re-create the Micro cosmos which had formerly been dissociated and broken.

    They will traverse the Staircase like an arrow and will suddenly find themselves in front of the second Threshold.

    The catechumen crosses the First Threshold under the impetus of a negative feeling: the horror of life in the wilderness, and the ardent desire to escape from it.

    To reach the Second Threshold, the two polar beings who present themselves in front of it must be holders of a positive password, which will be required from them at that precise moment.

    The Way opens to those who know what they want; know what they aspire to, on the Way and outside the Way, in an exterior life which after this can never again be detached from esoteric work. Happy are those who can be useful in it.

    The Door which leads to Life will open before them, and they will read on the pediment of the wall the sacramental inscription:

    The laborer is worthy of his hire.

    C's have said:

        "If one has the will of a Lion, one does not have the fate of a mouse!" Arkadiusz is strong willed. Must be to be seeker of worlds. To paraphrase: "I am become ONE... Creator of worlds."

Part 4


	
Article - Laura Knight-Jadczyk
Commentary on Boris Mouravieff's Gnosis

      

    Every man is born bearing within him the image of his polar being.
    As he grows, this image grows within him;
    It takes form and is filled with life and colour.
    Man is not conscious of it. Yet it is his ALTER EGO,
    The Lady of his dreams, his Princess of the Vision.
    In Quest of her he must eternally go.

    In Her alone, he will find a perfect echo of Himself:
    Of the most intimate, inexpressible movements of his soul, For in their union, the limit between the I and the Thou is obliterated.

    Since she is his Singular, his Legitimate Spouse.
    And Silence will then be the depositary of the fullness of their Love.

    To live in the True, with all lies excluded, is the prerogative of the Cycle of the Spirit: Light without shadow.

    We speak here about certain human beings who have attained or who are about to attain the Second Birth. The text leaves no room for ambiguity:

        Lie not to one another: seeing that you have put off the old man with his doings and have put on the new man, that is being renewed until the knowledge after the image of God: where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave and freeman; but Christ is all and in all.

    This is only addressed to those who are on the Way in their relations between themselves.

    He who reaches Love would not know how to lie. But to triumph over lies requires an esoteric culture which is inaccessible to ordinary man.

    This highlights the important problem of lying.

    The struggle against lying is long and drawn out. It is first of all a struggle against ourselves, against our spontaneous tendencies, and against that mechanicalness that makes us revert constantly to lying.

    Useless lies to others are far less harmful than lying to oneself - and easier to master and heal. Lying to oneself sometimes takes on finely shaded forms that necessitate total and sustained attention, together with methodical and persistent efforts.

    to eliminate useless lying to others does not demand continual effort: one must simply watch to see that it does not slip into conversation. At the moment when it is on our lips a simple effort of attention is sufficient to stop it. That is why in struggling for truth, it is recommended to begin with this type of lie.

    But, we easily understand that lying to oneself, or the struggle against this kind of lie, is not perceptible from the exterior.

    When we stop lying uselessly, this will also be unnoticed by those around us. One can say that in practice, the struggle against these two categories of lies does not alter man's relations with other men in any way, although it is very effective for the person who undertakes it. We can therefore begin it without delay, as long as we do it discreetly so as not to draw attention to ourselves, and so do not provoke increasing pressure from the General Law [of accident and mechanicalness which will try to circumvent these efforts; i.e. The Predator's mind/Matrix.]

    [...] As for efforts at suppressing lies to oneself, they entail quite different and important consequences. Such lies grow deep roots. In this domain, paradoxical situations sometimes arise, some of them of such psychological subtlety that it is difficult to draw them out of the shade.

    Here we must mention the question of marriages where one of the partners, having realized that this union is an error, persists in trying to convince him or herself of the contrary. If he is of an affectionate nature, he will redouble his amiability towards his partner as if truly toward his polar "other." The absurdity of the situation reaches its limits if the other partner reacts by adopting a corresponding attitude - without any sincere or spontaneous glow of tenderness.

    The danger from the esoteric point of view is that, by mere force of habit, such a situation takes on for one of the partners, or even for both of them, the value of true love. this kind of lying to oneself can go on for dozens of years with people who are amiable and of good faith, and they entail tragic disillusions in the end.

    The man who starts to struggle against lying to himself must be forewarned of these difficulties, and of the possible collapse of some or all his greatest values.

    All should know that true esoteric work only begins after the individual has passed through a general bankruptcy and has had his gods helplessly thrown to the ground.

    We have indicated the absolute necessity for anyone who aspires to esoteric development to cure himself as soon as possible of this deep-rooted habit of lying to himself.

    We shall now look at this problem from another angle: that of the objective results which man obtains when he is able to stop lying.

    This work takes time, demands the courage to face disillusion, and needs self-confidence and faith in the self. As the seeker advances, he feels a new sentiment.

    He will sometimes feel bitter regret as his beautiful dreams vanish, but at the same time he will feel himself more and more liberated.

    His growing sincerity towards himself will establish an atmosphere of truth in his inner life. The law proclaimed "you shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free" will apply to him in its fullness.

    The word "free" was deliberately chosen to contrast a state of slavery.

    After each operation of inner purification, painful though it may be, the seeker will feel more and more fully a profound gratitude for being freed from this absurd slavery.

    Having reached a certain stage in internal liberation, the individual will understand the full value of the magical power expressed in the word Freedom.

    The acquisition of Inner Freedom is the sine qua non condition of further success in esoteric work.

    This elimination of lying to the self enables one to observe the work of the lower centers in the self objectively. This observation is commenced from this "command post" of impartial observation and judgment of the individual who has overcome the lies to the self.

    When our interior world is thus purified by these rays of the "B", when we have ceased to lie to ourselves, how then are we to act towards others?

    This problem is far from easy.

    It is written: "the kingdom of heaven is forced, and it is the violent men who hold it."

    If we remember that the kingdom of heaven is within, and NOT outside us, then we begin to understand that some force or even violence must be employed INTERNALLY to retake our own fortress.

    This is very often necessary to eliminate the roots of Illusion within us, the mother of lies to ourselves.

    Thus we see that the test at the fourth step is decisive. Until lying stops, man drags along the defects of his past: lying, weakness, self-pity, inner compromise.

    Generally, it takes time, the opportunity and the possibility to rid himself of his baggage before committing himself to the fourth step is met. Many individuals, because of the weight of their past, waste time and allow many opportunities which present themselves to go by.

    But, on the fourth step, the balance sheet must be drawn up and accounts settled. Man, poor and naked, is accepted at the second Threshold, but only on condition that he is consistent and pure.

    The essential is that he be consistent, meaning that he contains within himself true Love, which can only be revealed by the cessation of lying to the self.

    Everything false within him will be burned by the flames of this blazing sword.

    All of these steps happen more or less together in many combinations. They are distributed unequally according to different personalities, and driven by the force of our Desire to be free.

    In stepping onto the Staircase, to approach and then cross the Second Threshold, man adopts a new attitude towards himself: from this point on, he takes his fate in his own hands.

    During later development, the Individuality becomes progressively integrated with the higher cosmos.

    Cassiopaeans:
    Q: (L) Let me ask this one before the tape runs out and we take a break. What is the "ultimate secret" being protected by the Consortium?
    A: You are not in control of yourselves, you are an experiment. [...]
    Q: (L) Yes. Okay. How "long", and I put long in quotes, because we know, as you say, there is no time, but how long, as we measure it, have the Grays been interacting with our race? The Grays, not the Lizards, the Grays, the cybergenetic probes?
    A: No.
    Q: (L) What do you mean, "No"?
    A: Time travelers, therefore, "Time is ongoing."
    Q: (L) Okay, recently I read a couple of books Jan gave me, "Knight in Shining Armor" and "Replay". Both of these books described time travel.
    A: No, not finished with answer. Do you understand the gravity of last response?
    Q: (L) They are time travelers, they can move forward and backward in time, they can play games with our heads... (T) They can set up the past to create a future they want. (D) They can organize things so that they can create the energy that they need... (L) They can also make things look good, make them feel good, make them seem good, they can make you have an idea one minute, and then the next minute, create some sort of situation that confirms that idea...
    A: When you asked how long, of course it is totally unlimited, is it not?
    Q: (L) That's not good. If they were to move back through space time and alter an event in our past, would that alteration in the past instantaneously alter our present as well?
    A: Has over and over and over.
    Q: (D) So they do it over and over and over, constantly? (L) So, at each...
    A: You just are not yet aware, and have no idea of the ramifications!!!
    Q: (L) We're getting a little glimmer! Yeah, I do, a little! (T) The ramifications of being able to move in and out of time and manipulate it the way you want (Jan/Laura) And the ramifications of what they're doing to us; what they are doing to us and what they will do to us, over and over. (Freddy) What did it say about over and over? (L) So, in other words, our only real prayer in this whole damn situation is to get out of this density level. That's what they're saying, that's what it sounds like to me.
    A: Close.
    Q: (L) Because, otherwise, we're just literally, as in that book, stuck in the replay over and over and over, and the Holocaust could happen over and over, and we could just, you know... Genghis Khan, Attila the Hun... over and over and over again. (T) We're stuck in a time loop; they're putting us in a time loop. (J) Are we in a time loop?
    A: Yes.
    Q: (D) I have a question about... there was a... (PAUSE) Mankind has found it necessary for some reason or other to appoint time for some reason or other. The only reason I can see is to have a means of telling, like in verbal or written communications...
    A: Control mechanism.
    Q: (T) Is there a way for us to break the control mechanism? Besides moving to 4th density? (D) That was part...
    A: Nope.
    Q: (D) When 4th density beings communicate it's telepathic, right?
    A: Yes.
    Q: (D) Okay, since time doesn't exist, how do you communicate about happenings?
    A: Rephrase, please; clarify.
    Q: (L) What she means to ask is, if you're communicating telepathically... (D) On 4th density.. (L) And time doesn't exist, how do you communicate about events as one happens now, as opposed to later and the next thing happens, and the next thing happens... (J) How is it sequential?
    A: Translate.
    Q: (D) Translate? Okay, let me explain what I mean. I mean, we talk about 1907 something happened...
    A: That is how it is done.
    Q: (T) Translate is how it is done. You translate the experience?
    A: From 4 to 3. And vice versa.
    Q: (L) So, in other words, it's almost like making movies. (J) Are linear thought processes part of it? Is it being linear and non-linear?
    A: Part of 3d illusion only.
    Q: (L) So, in other words, if you're a 4th density being, everything is more or less happening, excuse the term happening, everything is simultaneous, and if you wish to discuss or communicate or have any focus upon any particular aspect of this unified dimension, then what you do is you kind of extract it out, project it into 3d...
    A: Close.
    Q: (L) ... like a movie.
    A: But you will not understand fully until you get there.

    Mouravieff: The life of man is a film. It is certainly difficult for our Cartesian minds to grasp this concept. Our three-dimensional minds are badly adapted to ideas and facts which touch on the domain of the eternal.

    Incomprehensible as it may seem, our life is truly a film produced in accordance with a script. This film goes on continuously, without ever stopping, in such a way that, at the time of his death, man is born again. What seems absurd is that he is born in the same place, at the same date where he was born before, and of the same parents. So the film goes on again. Each human being, then, is born with his own particular film. this represents the field of action in which man is called to apply his conscious efforts.

    The repetition of the film is not reincarnation, although these two notions are often confused. Exterior man, who lives in the system of the Future-Past cannot embrace in a single moment the ensemble of his film, nor even the part that contains his immediate future. To do so, he would need to enlarge the slot of his Present.

    It thus happens to him that, faced with certain events, he will feel that he has already seen or lived those events. Some see in such phenomena the proof of so called reincarnation. In reality, phenomena of this sort are the result of a casual and temporary surge of fine energies in the organism: the slot of the individual Present then enlarges for a few moment, and some significant facts of the immediate future slip into the waking consciousness. In this way, the impression is created of a return of another time. In a certain way this is true, although the impression of having lived before is only caused by mechanical unfolding of the film.

    By reincarnation, we must understand a phenomenon of a very different order. Although the theoretical film revolves integrally on the plane of possibilities, meaning in eternity, the film of the exterior man clings to the plane of realization, that is, of Time, but only to the extent strictly necessary to satisfy the ends of the Ray of Creation.

    True reincarnation, on the other hand, occurs entirely in time, and belongs integrally to the domain of the Real, well understood as part of the broader frame of Manifestation. The human personality is not a reality in the proper sense of the word, but a possibility. It plays a role in the film to which it is attached, from which it will not disappear until the moment of the Second Birth. At that moment, it will cease to be a Personality. Because of its indestructible union with the real "I", it will be transfigured, and so it will become an Individuality. As long as man lives in the wilderness, self-satisfied and immersed in lies and illusions, the film will unfold with mechanical inflexibility, and the Personality will remain entirely unchanged.

    These circumstances start to change the moment man crossed the first Threshold. This passage can be compared to the conception of the future Individuality. The Staircase symbolizes the period of gestation, and the crossing of the second Threshold represents the second Birth, the birth of Individuality. As man becomes more and more integrated with his "I", growing his Individuality, he becomes progressively integrated with the Cosmos and acquires "gifts" appropriate to his individual nature. Simultaneously, he progressively participates in real, objective existence, which finally characterizes his being.

    This is liberation from the bonds of the film.

    It is only at this point of evolution that true individual reincarnation becomes possible.

    True reincarnation is not mechanical; it is done consciously, generally to accomplish a mission.

    Cassiopaeans:
    Q: (LC) Well, if that's the case! I want to ask about past life relations between us. I'm sure there is.
    A: Be specific.
    Q: (LC) Are there any specific past life connections between any of the women in this room?
    A: Who?
    Q: (LC) Well, let's start with Laura. Do I have a past life connection with Laura?
    A: Before we answer that, we wish to hear from you what you perceive a past life circumstance to be.
    [..] How do you perceive the reincarnation process to be?
    Q: (LC) I perceive it as you come back with people you choose to come back with, and that you choose people that you are karmically connected to. (I) I see it a little bit differently than that...
    A: Aha! We have a variance!
    Q: (I) I think that when we die and go to 5th density, that we make pacts with people in each incarnation, so when you come back, it is coming back to fulfill that pact. (LC) Yes, that is the way my line of thinking is going. But, when they asked that question, I was thinking that you have people you come back with because of closeness. Somebody may be your mother in one life, and there is a love bond, and then there are other people that you come back with because you have to resolve something to let go of that person rather than to get closer.
    A: This is partially correct. But, there is more to it than this. For example, one can incarnate on various planes of existence, not just the one you perceive currently. And, one may actually reincarnate on more than one plane concurrently, if one is advanced enough to do this.
    Q: (L) Are you suggesting that ...
    A: Yes, we are!
    Q: (L) I was thinking it, but they didn't let me finish. For the record, I was thinking that we are all part of the same soul unit here.
    A: To an extent, but you may not yet understand what exactly a "soul unit" is in that sense. And of course, there is more than one sense for this as well. The "trick" that 3rd density STS life forms will learn, either prior to transition to 4th density, or at the exact juncture, is to think in absolutely limitless terms. The first and most solid step in this process is to not anticipate at all. This is most difficult for you. We understand this, but this as also why we keep reiterating this point. For example, imagine if one of your past lives is also a future life? [...]
    Q: (P) Now, I just want to say that I think that we have all of us here traveled back in time to change the way things are now. We inserted ourselves into this time period to wake up and see what is really happening. This is 3rd density thinking, I know, but it is the only way I can describe it. We looked back on the way things happened, the way the world is now, and we have come back to change things. We have come from the future, to wake up now, because we didn't wake up before. (C) Maybe that's our "past life/future life" connection here? (P) Right, we all agreed to insert ourselves in this time line.... (L) So, we ARE from the future... (P) Because the world is going in this direction, and SOMETHING had to be done. That's what I see. (I) Yes. We all decided to come back, but there was a strong possibility that we would not be able to wake up and link up. And that's why so many things happened to attempt to keep us from getting together. (P) Not just that, things happen to keep us from waking up period! We've all been bombarded with stuff all our lives. (I) Yes, and when we started waking up, and realized that we HAD to come together to "link" to DO whatever it is we are going to do, there has to be all kinds of things to prevent it even! [Laughter] (S) I would like to ask a question about synchronicity...
    A: Wait a minute... someone said something a short while ago that is surprisingly close to the truth. Now just a moment... reflect please.
    Q: (L) P*** was saying that we have come back from the future and inserted ourselves into this timeline...
    A: Yes. That is close to being totally correct!
    Q: (L) In terms of reincarnation, that we were talking about a few minutes before that, we are possibly incarnations of ourselves incarnated at different levels. This just happens to be one of the levels of reality that we are occupying, but there are other selves at other levels thinking and doing other level stuff, and these other levels are perceived by us as the future...
    A: Maybe for some of you, but let us not get ahead of ourselves.
    Q: (P) The C's say that they are US in the future. So, we, being THEM in the future, some of who they are in the future, have come back as us, to do what we are doing, to undo what is happening on Earth...
    A: Close, but more complex than that. It would be difficult for you to completely understand at this point, but let us just say that you are close.

    Mouravieff: It is important to grasp clearly the difference which exists between the film, a mixture of possibilities, and reincarnation in time, which belongs to the domain of the Real, and to understand the meaning of this difference.

    At the time of the second Birth, that is to say, by crossing the Second Threshold, man escapes his bondage to the film, and enters the domain of redemption. He is then admitted into the sacred brotherhood of living Beings. These beings are an unshakable force: those who are part of it are no longer subject to illness or sorrow. Death loses its hold over them. They have overcome the world.

    In theory, the film in which man is born and in which he lives can go on until the end of the world, on condition that he is happy, satisfied with himself, attributing his virtues to himself, and blaming others for his mistakes and misfortunes. Properly speaking, this kind of existence cannot be considered as human; it could be described as anthropoid. This term is justified in the sense that exterior man, immersed in self-satisfaction, represents the crowning achievement of millions of years of evolution of the species from its animal ancestors, yet from the point of view of esoteric evolution, he is a possibility which has not yet been realized.

    If we envisage the problem of esoteric evolution from the point of view of the film and the different parts man can play in it, it is clear that this kind of evolution is impossible as long as the film can always be considered as turning in the same circle. People who perform in such a film are those we have called anthropoids, puppets, the dead who, in the words of Jesus, "believe themselves to be alive."

    Esoteric evolution starts when man, by his conscious efforts, proves capable of breaking the circle and transforming it into an ascending spiral. The spiral represents an intermediate state between the position where the human Personality is found to be trapped in the film, which revolves mechanically in a way hardly separated from the eternal plane, and that of the perfect, free Individuality, who is able, if need arises, to reincarnate consciously in Time.

    This is an intermediate state in this sense, that the film definitely departs from the plane of the eternal, from the plane of possibilities. The curve of life, which for exterior man does not in practice differ from a circle, transforms itself into a spiral and does not end - as it did previously - almost at its point of departure: the distance between these two points now marks a definite progression in Time.

    The film in the form of a spiral belongs to human beings who climb the staircase. Complete disengagement of the film is produced at the moment of crossing the second threshold. If man is able to do that successfully during a single life, so breaking the circle for the very first time, he does not return to it. Such a case is very rare: it is the lot of the just.

    Generally, this liberation requires several lives; several revolutions of the spiral. As a general rule, each revolution occurs in Time, and consequently can appear to be a reincarnation. In reality, it is nothing but a return to exterior life. A pseudo-reincarnation like this is neither conscious nor personal: it is the actors in the film who return, and they do not remember any previous experiences.

    However, a change is possible as soon as the conscious efforts of man increase the effect of the Time factor by enlarging perception of the Present. In a film which unfolds in a spiral in this way, the contents of the play change; they change in two ways: first in each life, that is, during each revolution, and also from spiral to spiral. The composition of the cast, the circumstances, and the scenery all change. Two elements however remain permanent: first, the general aim, to reach and cross the second Threshold; then the absolute condition for crossing this Threshold, that all the karmic debts which have been accumulated in the present life, as well as during previous spirals, must be neutralized and liquidated.

    Before the Second Threshold, every drama must be played out to its denouement. The work is hard and difficult because man constantly makes mistakes.

    The attentive reader has already understood that following the spiral, or climbing the Staircase, is reserved for human beings who have already absorbed a certain quantity of "B" influences and who thus possess a more or less developed magnetic center. This does not guarantee that they will make no more errors.

    It is true that from the time man first mounts the Staircase he is watched, especially if he makes sincere and considerable efforts. The Esoteric Brotherhood offers him a helping hand. Certain meetings, a play of favorable circumstances, are the forms taken by this help. This assistance does not, however, free him of the need to work on himself and to go on making conscious efforts. In addition, it must be said that often the proffered help is not used, because man does not listen to the advice given, or because he does not grasp the meaning of the favorable circumstances and the possibilities of progress which open before him. He is still more than half a creature of the domain of Illusion, he continues to take frequent impulsive decisions, and often turns against his own avowed aims.

    It must be understood that as long as a man has not attained and crossed the Second Threshold, he will have to start all over again. He will restart every spiral in the wilderness, he will once again have to discern the Cosmic Solar influences, cross the First Threshold, and climb the Staircase step by step. It is true that no conscious effort is ever lost, but the experience acquired in one spiral only appears in the next in the form of innate personal aptitudes, or vague recollections of people in the cast.

    We should know that, at the end of a spiral (incarnation), a comparison is made between the film as it was conceived at the time of birth and what it has become at the time of death. The balance sheet between these two states is drawn up, as in accounting, by listing assets and liabilities, followed by a profit/loss statement. This will show the result of the elapsed life objectively.

    This balance sheet furnishes the basic elements for composing the film at the start of the following spiral.

    If we could avoid all errors and complications in this new experience, produced as a result of free movements, esoteric evolution would then occur in a harmonious rising curve.

    Generally, this is not the case. Man most often comes to this idea of evolution after he has already complicated the film to which he belongs.

    But true evolution cannot occur except on the basis of the original film - after all artificially added elements have been eliminated. The latter is conditional on a return to the PURITY of the centers, especially the emotional center which - at least at the start - is the sole receptacle of Cosmic Solar influences.

    Cassiopaeans:
    Q: (L) Are instincts different from emotions?
    A:Yes.
    Q: (L) How can you tell the difference between instinctive knowledge and emotional reactions?
    A: Emotions involve wishful thinking, instincts are "gut feelings," psychic in nature, and are stronger. When it is wishful thinking, there is always psychic instinct seeping through which you can access if you use reason and examine your lessons of the past.
    Q: (L) Is it also correct that emotion can be used to mislead, that is emotions that are twisted and generated strictly from the flesh or false programming?
    A: Emotion that limits is an impediment to progress. Emotion is also necessary to make progress in 3rd density. It is natural. When you begin to separate limiting emotions based on assumptions from emotions that open one to unlimited possibilities, that means you are preparing for the next density.
    Q: (L) What about Love?
    A: What about it?
    Q: (L) There are many teachings that are promulgated that Love is the key, the answer. They say that illumination and knowledge and what-not can all be achieved through love.
    A: The problem is not the term "love," the problem is the interpretation of the term. Those on third density have a tendency to confuse the issue horribly. After all, they confuse many things as love. When the actual definition of love as you know it is not correct either. It is not necessarily a feeling that one has that can also be interpreted as an emotion, but rather, as we have told you before, the essence of light which is knowledge is love, and this has been corrupted when it is said that love leads to illumination. Love is Light is Knowledge. Love makes no sense when common definitions are used as they are in your environment. To love you must know. And to know is to have light. And to have light is to love. And to have knowledge is to love.

    Mouravieff:
    The heart must therefore be pure, and if not already pure, it must be purified. This is the sine qua non condition of success.

    All the discussion of lying in all its aspects is given to emphasize the absolute need for purifying the heart, and for beginning to re-educate the emotional center in a positive direction. [Remember, the emotions are represented by the horse pulling the coach.]

    This necessity explains the meaning of the words of Jesus: "Except you turn, and become as little children, you shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven."

    This refers specifically to the emotional life. Many have interpreted this as a restriction on the development of the intellect. This is a huge mistake. Intelligence and intellect must be developed and stimulated. The admonition to "become as little children" only points to the need for purity of the centers, NOT the idea of keeping them in a primitive state.

    Paul wrote: Brothers, be not children in that which concerns judgment, be children in what concerns malice, but as to judgment, be fully grown men."

    ***

    It is now time to turn to a possible short cut in esoteric work which can rapidly take us to the second Threshold.

    This is a possibility offered to Polar beings, those couples described by the ancient Tradition in the myth of the Androgyne.

    On the basis of the preceding analysis, the essential data for the film of any ordinary person can be described as follows: as the hero of the romance of his own life, the subject must necessarily be the star of the film.

    But he can also play a minor role in the film of people who play a secondary role in his own film. In this way, each film gets enmeshed with other films, where the same people are found in totally different situations.

    One must also distinguish between two categories of actors.

    The first are really part of the cast. A definite role is assigned to them: they are organically tied to the film.

    The second group only appear by accident in the film, drawn into the action by the free movements of the hero. This complexity is further increased because some of the actors who have genuine parts in the film play their roles badly, while others play roles which are not their own. Situations like this are widespread.

    The human Personality is an organism with multiple parts or facets, 987 to be exact. In the ideal case, only realized by polar beings, and the only effective one from the esoteric point of view, the 987 facets of man and woman are strictly polar. These are the predestined husband and wife whose union will create a true couple.

    However, the cast contains other people, who play roles organically tied to that of the hero, and who are necessary to bring the film in its ensemble to its natural end. these are friend souls, brother souls, sister souls, collaborating souls, servant souls, etc. The Personalities of each of them have a certain number of facts identical to those of the hero, for actors of the same sex, or polar for actors of the opposite sex. In the case of brothers and sisters, the number of identical or polar facets can be as many as half or even more.

    The lack of discernment and of sincerity towards ourselves, the innate desire to find a perfect resonance to the vibration of our soul, and the impatience that follows, all multiplied by the action of the General Law [of accident], induce us too often to contract unions which can only result in absurd situations. Instead of resisting the mirage; instead of waiting and seeking, we slip into imperfect unions, which are a source of suffering both for the partners and their children. In addition, these unions alter the meaning of the film in its ensemble, and so corrupt the personal lives of all the actors in the drama. Lastly, the esoteric results foreseen in the initial composition of the film are gravely compromised.

    It is as a result of considering on the matrimonial plane, or through lack of consideration on the sexual plane, that most of our errors are committed, including those which demand the heaviest payment.

    Even beings of good faith are not exempt from error.

    To confuse a brother or sister soul for husband or wife compounds very complicated situations, especially from the esoteric point of view. The situation is all the more confused when children are born from such unions.

    Life then takes on the character of a perpetual compromise with oneself. the moral and physical health of "accidentally united couples" suffers: with changes in the intellectual center due to cheating and lying; heart disease if the emotional center is sensitive and still aspires to the truth; also diseases of obscure origin, of which cancer is one that attacks the body in its most fragile parts. In every case, the condition necessarily leads to permanent loss of fine energies which, in its turn, brings on accelerated aging and leads to premature death.

    Difficult as are these situations that arise out of our errors, they must not prevent anyone who throws himself into esoteric work from finding the courage in himself to look them in the face and to search for a satisfactory outcome. If the Devil - the General Law - tries to lead us into new errors to obstruct our esoteric evolution, the supporting hand of the Lord is always stretched out to help us. Yet our minds, too rational and too realistic, often stop us from sensing this help.

    When a situation has been entangled by our errors, the Gordian knot must NOT be cut, it must be untied in such a way that the participants, both tied by the same knot, feel only relief at the disappearance of a situation which was simply a source of suffering for both.

    If the situation is resolved, the original meaning of the film and its normal development can be found.

    The ensemble of people organically linked in one film forms a team. In the initial conception of the film, this team must attain a predetermined aim as a result of the way the participants play their roles in the play of life. This esoteric aim is always different from the aims we follow under the influences of the General Law [the Matrix]

    The objective for such a team always has an esoteric meaning in fact, though the Personalities which compose it may be very different. they will share a deep need: a desire to end lies and illusions once and for all, the escape the domination of the [Predator's mind] and, in one form or another, to reach that objective existence in which man finds his real "I" and identifies himself with it.

    Here we must describe the principal law which underlies the formation of these teams. On the material plane, the greatest reward goes to him who commands. On the esoteric plane, the greatest reward goes to him who serves.

    The confusion between these two important master ideas - that of commanding and of serving - sometimes appears dramatic. Even among Jesus' disciples, the question of knowing who was greatest among them tormented them.

    The more evolved the team, the more important the task entrusted to it. History provides examples of the work of teams in all fields. the role of women in teams is particularly marked in crucial periods of the history of peoples.

    [...]Once the First Threshold is crossed, esoteric work will begin to reveal the true meaning of the film. Man must proceed with an impartial analysis of its contents: the role that each of the actors plays in it - and the value of this role - must be passed through a sieve.

    Gradually, as this stripping work progresses, the positive or negative character of different roles emerges more and more clearly. After this, inappropriate elements tend to disappear from the scene.

    At the end of this analysis, the film will contain only a reduced number of actors. but all of them are organically bound together, and with the hero, by the contents of the play, as it was conceived from the beginning of these experiences... which are pursued by the real "I" through centuries or even millennia. The play must then be played out to its resolution or denouement.

    The basic task of man, once he has crossed the first Threshold, is to shelter himself from the karmic influences which are the effects of errors committed in his free movements, either in the present life or in the past. In the past, workers used to go to some monastery or hermitage where they were able to concentrate on introspective work. In the present, our times require energetic and rapid methods.

    Our last question is to examine the method whereby the Staircase between the two Thresholds can be climbed more quickly, while we remain and work in the contemporary world.

    This means exists: it is to work as a couple. However, for this esoteric work to be completed successfully by two people, it is essential that the two beings - man and woman - are integrally polar.

    Cassiopaeans:
    Q: (L) Let me ask a question. Earlier they said something about being on the threshold of an experience. And now they say something is going to unfold in front of you. Are the two response "threshold" and "unfold in front of you," connected?
    A: Of course!!!
    Q: (L) Okay, he is on the threshold of some kind of experience. Is there some way that we might identify this experience? Is it going to be so outstanding that you can't miss it? Or, is it going to be something that you have to pay attention to or you might miss it?
    A: What does "threshold" imply?
    Q: (L) Well, a door. It's a door. Does this mean he is going to go through a door, psychically, spiritually, physically? Going to someone's house?
    A: It does not just imply a "door," but also one's positioning, and a sense of inevitability.
    Q: (L) Is there something I can do to help?
    A: Have you not helped already?
    Q: (L) But, I mean specifically in this "threshold" and "unfolding" experience?
    A: Yes! And, by the way, Arkadiusz, science is most spiritual indeed!
    Q: (L) Well, considering certain other elements, I was just wondering if our pathways are supposed to now be parallel or diverge... how they relate from this point...
    A: Seems to us that your pathways are intertwining!
    Q: (L) The use of the word "intertwining" is curious. You used that in regard to the relationship between EM and gravity. Is there a parallel?
    A: If you wish. [...]
    Q: (L) One last question: you say "combine energies." Is there any reason why this will facilitate the pursuit of answers?
    A: Complementary souls.

    Mouravieff:
    In the "long path," by successive elimination based on long and minute analysis of his film, and after new errors and new failures, man may end by finding his legitimate spouse, a fully integral polar being with whom to unite himself.

    In the "short path", man must begin by a conscious search for his polar being. If found, they can work together on the film which - in its origin - is common to them both.

    A man alone is incomplete. But just where he is weak, his polar being is strong. together, they form an integral being: their union leads to the fusion of their Personalities and a faster crystallization of their complete subtle bodies, united into a common second Birth.

    This is the redemption of "original sin."

    The system of films is conceived in such a way that polar beings will necessarily meet in life, in certain cases more than once. Only the confused ties contracted in this life by each of them, as a result of their free movements, combined with the karmic consequences of one or more previous experiences, can divert the man or woman from the ONLY being with whom they could from a Micro cosmos.

    If there were no karmic debt, everything would go wonderfully: two young people would meet in the most favorable family and social atmosphere, and their union would represent a true fairy-tale. But this is not reality.

    Obeying the principle of Imperfection, and moved by the action of the General Law, the two predestined beings will commit errors. Deeply buried in lies, they do not generally know how to appreciate the gift they are given. Often, they do not even recognize each other.

    If this is the case, then an agonizing question is put: is there one or more means to detect our polar being, and if so, what are these means?

    To meet that person, to do so without recognition, to let our polar being pass by, is the worst mistake we could possibly make: because we would remain in our factitious life, without light.

    Must not everything be sacrificed in favor of a union which is the only chance of our life: the promise of return to paradise lost?

    Nevertheless we should beware of the last trap, one we can fall into just at the moment when ineffable happiness seems to smile upon us.

    We have just said: all must be sacrifices; we have not said: all must be broken.

    If, having recognized one another, the two polar beings triumph over this last ordeal or test, often the most painful, the new life, will open in front of them, as they are then called to be One on earth and in heaven.

    But let us now return to the question of knowing how not to pass by after having met our true alter ago, the pledge of happiness and salvation.

    There is a whole series of subjective and objective clues which assist us in recognizing our polar being. The polarization is manifested on ALL planes simultaneously: sexual, physical, mental and spiritual.

    Two elements must be taken into consideration: If it is correct to say that the predestined man and woman are absolutely polar beings, this polarity is not simple because, to a certain measure, both are physically, mentally and spiritually hermaphroditic beings. That measure, that proportion, is at the same time, sufficient and necessary. It is necessary to permit every being coming into this world to carry within himself the image of the polar being; this image is expressed, in each case, by means of the organ of the opposite sex which exists in every being in a state of non-development. It is, so to say, a part of the flesh and blood of his polar being that each one of us carries within himself. this proportion is sufficient, that is, it is the absolute minimum that will not jeopardize the complete polarity, since the proportion of hermaphroditism in both polar beings is strictly equivalent.

    The second element, which is subjective, is the distortion of our personality due to conscious or unconscious deviations to which the initial film was subject during the course of our existence. Distortions of this kind make it more difficult to recognize the polar being, and can make us less willing to exert ourselves to unite with that being.

    [...] It is the Androgyne who constitutes a true Micro cosmos, not the isolated man or woman. The creation of man in the image and likeness of god was in the form of the Androgyne: this description refers to the joint astral body of two polar beings.

    For man as for woman, salvation in the bosom of the Absolute depends on their reintegration in the Micro cosmos, as Paul indicates explicitly: "neither is the woman without the man, nor the man without the woman in the Lord."

    Man and woman are in fact, incomplete beings who - taken apart - cannot reflect in His fullness the image of God who is all in all.

    it is an axiom that every man and every woman has a polar being.

    Nevertheless, not all human beings feel the imperative need to be united to their polar being. Beings who live enclosed in their Personality without thinking deeply - which constitutes the great majority of humanity - enthusiastically involve themselves in a life ruled by material influences, and do not really feel the need for such a union. For them, the polar being is on the same plane as everyone else. The Personality does not perceive anything exceptional in him, and if by some chance an extraordinary impression is experienced, it is instead felt as something abnormal and embarrassing.

    We can speak of couples formed under the influence of the Law of Accident in which the partners have opposite aspirations. At the base of such unions we often find, beside a double error of judgment, the influences of karmic debt, remote or recent. the most intelligent attitude to take on such occasions is to unite the efforts of the couple to unravel the situation to their mutual benefit. Left to itself, the situation will only get worse.

    Very special care must be taken of the children of such a union, as they suffer within the union. Everything must be done to remedy this. As a general rule, we must not lose sight of the fact that, even if it is permitted to the human being to offer himself in sacrifice, he has no right to accept the sacrifice of others. To sacrifice yourself to a union that is formed under the law of accident only teaches your children to do likewise and hinders their possibilities of ever discovering their own polar being.

    Accelerated evolution of the hero of a film via work on the self - i.e. purification - brings him ever nearer to his polar being. At the same time, it automatically removes from the film those personalities who are not organically integral.

    After the formation of the magnetic center within him, man starts to feel the desire, the need, to be united to his polar being. This desire and need will increase in proportion to the growth of the latter.

    The concept of the Androgyne has purely mythical or theoretical value for ordinary man. But we now realize that a living aspiration to be re-integrated in the Micro cosmos - the most direct way to the re-integration in the Absolute - is the fruit of a high moral culture within the individual.

    As mentioned, esoteric evolution is conditioned at the start by bankruptcy, a moral breakdown. To make progress after this, man must know exactly where he stands. He must SEE himself.

    Isaac the Syrian said that he who has been able to see himself as he IS, is better than he who has seen angels.

    what we call bankruptcy, the ancient traditions call "death." It is death while still in a living body. One must first die, then be resurrected.

     By progressively taking his fate into his own hands, man at the same time takes responsibility for ALL the partners in his film.

    He must restore the original meaning of his film, then push the development of the latter in such a way that the "play" be properly played out to its intended denouement.

    The hero, while working on himself, must apply himself to create new circumstances around him, which will enhance the unfolding of the action towards its originally intended conclusion.

    His exterior efforts must above all be directed towards the creation of these circumstances, NOT towards seeking direct influence over people. Such direct influence over people may seem opportune, but it is an error. Instead of unraveling the situation, the influence creates karmic debts which complicate things all the more. One must be very prudent and circumspect.

    Yet new circumstances must be created in a way that effectively helps those interested to act in the direction desired.

    Once again: man should seek to serve, not to impose himself.

    Patience, perseverance and faith are qualities of great practical value in this work.

    For man to recognize his polar being, he must be fully attentive on all planes accessible to his consciousness. In fact, as a result of the distortion of the film, the meeting always occurs in circumstances and in a manner least expected, generally at a moment and in a form which resembles nothing he could ever have imagined.

    The rule is precise: to recognize his polar being, man must know himself.

    This is obviously logical: to recognize his alter ego, man must first recognize his own ego.

    We are thus confronted once again with the problem of the search for the way.

    It is true that the "I" of the body, like the "I" of the personality, aspire to find the perfect response from another being. This means that ONLY by identifying himself more and more with his REAL "I" that a man magnetizes the union with his polar being.

    It is with a heart full of faith, sharpening within himself his highest faculties of intuition and attention, his sense of critical analysis taken to the highest point of alertness, that man will go in search of the being without whom he is not real.

    As it was for the troubadour long ago, it is in Courtly Love that he can hope to find and recognize "la Dame de ses Pensees."

    The difficulty we find in discovering our polar beings lies in the fact that we are deformed, and constantly distort our film by free movements. We must rectify our own distortion and renounce our impulsive movements. This explains the prescription not to act under the influence of only one center. It is the necessity to correct for our distortion, which, logically, imposes on us the need, both in reception and transmission, for conscious effort to make our emotional and intellectual centers work together.

    When polar beings meet, by what immediately perceptible signs can humans who are still imperfect, still deformed by karmic debt, be certain in all objectivity that they are not making a mistake?

    Here are some indispensable criteria that can have objective value in mutual recognition.

    From the first meeting, in the presence of the polar being, both the "I" of the Personality and the "I" of the body vibrate in a manner which resembles nothing ever felt before.

    The reason for this is that these "I's" find themselves then in the presence of their First Love which continues through the centuries. Without clearly being conscious of it, the polar beings know each other; and this knowledge, as ancient as they are themselves, is expressed by the voice of their subconsciousness. This creates an atmosphere of absolute confidence and SINCERITY from the moment they meet.

    Q: (L) Last Sunday morning, I had a very strange experience similar to what Al-Arabi describes as being in a 'state.' It was like being taken up into a condition of near madness, Ark was there [as in a vision], and then, when [the intensity of the emotion] became unbearable, I deliberately pulled myself back and I was cold, shaking and rocking. I was shivering like I would never get warm and I could FEEL my soul rocking in my body. I would like to know exactly what this was?
    A: Balancing of half-self.
    Q: (L) What is a half-self?
    A: Your starter version, relating to birth karmic imprint.
    Q: (L) What in the world does THAT mean?
    A: What you were assigned with at the onset of this incarnation. What you started with. This must be periodically re-balanced at apex of significant junctures.
    Q: (L) The next thing that happened was that a few days later, I went unconscious and Ark saw me come in the window [5 thousand miles away]. What happened?
    A: Learning is fun!

    Q: As you know, there is a flood in Poland, and Ark has to go back, there is so much that must be done, but the government offices may be closed, the court session may be delayed indefinitely, God knows what is going to happen. What is the source of this dreadful disaster in Poland?
    A: Sopophoric screen alterations of the magnetic belt overlay.
    Q: And what is causing these screen alterations of the magnetic belt overlay?
    A: Influences of Acquiim.
    Q: What is Acquiim?
    A: 4th density overseer.
    Q: Does that mean sporofic screen alteration?
    A: Soporific/phosphorous.
    Q: What is the purpose of this screen alteration?
    A: Deterrence of colinear wave reading consciousness units.
    Q: What is a 'colinear wave reading consciousness unit?'
    A: Suggest you "look in the mirror."
    Q: Well! I don't know if I like being a colinear wave reading consciousness unit!
    A: Why not?
    Q: Because I don't like feeling responsible for all these people who are suffering in this disaster!
    A: Responsible? Are you altering the weather?
    Q: Well, no. But, if they will go to that extent to thwart us, is it safe for him to go back?
    A: If he takes precautions. [...]
    Q: When you said 'colinear wave reading consciousness units,' and 'look in the mirror,' was that a clue that Ark and I are mirror image consciousness units?
    A: Not exactly.
    Q: Well, in a previous session, you said something about being a 'half soul,' and my assumption was that he was a half-soul and I was a half-soul, and together we made a whole soul. But, since that time, I have wondered about this...
    A: No one is unto themselves a half soul.
    Q: Okay, what would give me a more clear understanding about 'half soul balancing?'
    A: The soul as read as a unit of completion. It is the communication which completes the whole in each.
    Q: What are the potentials of colinear wave reading consciousness units?
    A: Specifics.
    Q: Well, if an overseer in 4th density wishes to prevent unification of same, there must be some reason; that there is something that the 4th density STS would not like to see happen. What is it?
    A: Is that not self-evident?
    Q: So, does that mean that it is important for us to be physically together to do whatever this is?
    A: Tis preferable.

    ***

    This is the Touchstone: for polar beings do NOT LIE to each other. They do not need to lie, for inwardly both are one single being, from the depths of which the real "I" issues his call and gives his assent.

This is also true. Ark and I simply find it impossible to lie to each other. Even silly little "avoidances" become like huge barriers and we are compelled from inside to reveal every thought and feeling and idea. And this was true from the very beginning. We knew, somehow, that to lie would be a disaster.

    After this, that absolute, spontaneous sincerity constitutes the basis of their relationship.

    This gives these two beings an otherwise inconceivable feeling of Freedom in Unity, which ends the impression of servitude and isolation under which we ordinarily live.

    Soon afterwards, vague reminiscences of past experiences will start to come to the surface in their waking consciousness.

This was absolutely the case for both Ark and myself. Past life memories literally flooded into our waking and sleeping consciousnesses.

    The reader will now understand the deepest reason why lying to oneself is forbidden: he who lies to himself will also lie to his alter ego. That will be the end of the miracle.

    The wonderful side of the meeting will disappear behind a curtain of trivial lies, which will rapidly take the aspect of an impassable wall.

    This is how and why exterior man passes by his polar being without recognizing her. this is why practical work on the esoteric Way starts and necessarily continues with a struggle against lying to oneself. Success in this field is indispensable.

    To reach this aim, no price whatsoever is too high to pay.

    If they are open to the truth, and if their meeting makes chords - silent until now - vibrate in harmony within them both, the way is then marked out, for polar beings, by their conscious efforts to re-create the Micro cosmos which had formerly been dissociated and broken.

    They will traverse the Staircase like an arrow and will suddenly find themselves in front of the second Threshold.

    The catechumen crosses the First Threshold under the impetus of a negative feeling: the horror of life in the wilderness, and the ardent desire to escape from it.

    To reach the Second Threshold, the two polar beings who present themselves in front of it must be holders of a positive password, which will be required from them at that precise moment.

    The Way opens to those who know what they want; know what they aspire to, on the Way and outside the Way, in an exterior life which after this can never again be detached from esoteric work. Happy are those who can be useful in it.

    The Door which leads to Life will open before them, and they will read on the pediment of the wall the sacramental inscription:

    The laborer is worthy of his hire.

    C's have said:

        "If one has the will of a Lion, one does not have the fate of a mouse!" Arkadiusz is strong willed. Must be to be seeker of worlds. To paraphrase: "I am become ONE... Creator of worlds."

Article - Laura Knight-Jadczyk
Commentary on Boris Mouravieff's Gnosis

    Based on our extensive scientific research, the planet is about to "rock and  roll" - we figure about 2009 give or take six months - and this is the material  manifestation of the "cyclic event" of the "cosmic shock," so to say.  

    Having now Mouravieff's piece of the puzzle, I have just assembled from my  notes a little book (well, maybe not so little) entitled "Ancient Science,"  I will send you  a copy for review.  I will paste in here part of the introduction which serves  to explicate some of our ideas:

    After over thirty years of research, the one thing that has become evident is  that the energies of Creation emanate "downward," and our individuality as  human beings is merely an expression of the "Theological Dramas," so to say.   To attempt to exert our will or to make our voice travel "upward," against  Creation results only in a clash of forces.   It is, in essence, an attempt to  violate the Free Will of Creation, i.e. Hubris.  This is why praying for  material changes, rituals designed to "change" reality, "positive thinking"  with the "intent" to change something "up there," in order to receive the  benefits "down here," is always doomed to produce more strife, misery and  suffering globally.  "Seek ye first the kingdom of Heaven..." and this kingdom  is - or CAN be - within.

    In other words, what we CAN do is to prepare ourselves for the emanations that  are traveling "downward" to be better received.  This is the essential point of  Castaneda's Don Juan when he said:

    One of the greatest accomplishments of the seers of the Conquest was a  construct he called the three-phase progression.  By understanding the nature  of man, they were able to reach the incontestable conclusion that if seers can  hold their own in facing [human] petty tyrants, they can certainly face the  unknown with impunity, and then they can even stand the presence of the  unknowable.

     

    The average man's reaction is to think that the order of that statement should  be reversed," he went on. "A seer who can hold his own in the face of the  unknown can certainly face petty tyrants. But that's not so. What destroyed the  superb seers of ancient times was that assumption. We know better now. We know  that nothing can temper the spirit of a warrior as much as the challenge of  dealing with impossible people in positions of power. Only under those  conditions can warriors acquire the sobriety and serenity to stand the pressure  of the unknowable.11 Castaneda, Carlos, The Fire From Within

     

    All around us we see the results of this error: the idea that we can exert our  will and voice upward to change what is "above" us in order to change our  reality.  This idea is at the root of rites and rituals, demanding, pleading,  visualizations, "workings," and so forth.  When people think that "meditating  on compassion," or "feeling the feelings of all beings," is going to result in  the "sonic entrainment of the heart's rhythm [being] braided into more complex  and coherent patterns," which will then enable the person to "create a diamond  imperishable body for use as a teaching vehicle down here on earth," has missed  the entire point.  To compare such ideas to the true work of Seeker of  Ascension is simply ignorant.

    An extensive study of the historical literature shows that those who actually  MAY HAVE achieved Ascension don't just sit down one day and meditate on  compassion or the feeling of oneness and "boom!" experience an "implosive soul  force."  Before Ascension can ever achieved the point of being able to think  even momentarily about "the oneness of all beings," or the "feelings of all  beings," the REAL seekers have spent many, many years in the struggle to "face  petty tyrants," or to fully REALIZE objective reality.  He has repeatedly  exposed himself to as many "unpleasant experiences" as he can find, all the  while struggling to master his emotions, his desires, his physicality.  It is  the work of making the physical vehicle "down here," receptive to whatever may  be "up there," as opposed to trying to forcibly create something "up there," in  order to have it "down here." 

    Nevertheless, the many teachers of ascension continue to expound on the subject  by saying such interesting things as: "It is possible to ascend physically as  Jesus and the other masters demonstrated.  In this process, the physical cells  are all expanded into a higher frequency.  The physical body begins to glow  from within and radiate light.  Much as the blades of a fan seem to "disappear"  as they rotate faster and faster, a body that is vibrating at higher  frequencies seems to disappear from the third dimension. Its primary focus is  on a higher dimension. It seems "magical" to those who remain focused on the  denser third dimension, but it is a perfectly natural process."

    Unfortunately, such promulgators of wisdom do not seem to be able to  demonstrate what they are teaching.  But nobody usually notices that part  because they are too busy having "spiritual experiences" produced by any number  of "techniques" which make them "feel good" long enough to whip out the credit  card or sign the check.  A considerable period of time is required to finally  come to the realization that techniques that relieve stress or produce "good  feelings," have done nothing to actually change their lives or their  "vibrations."  They are still recognized by their neighbor's dog, they still  find new gray hairs on their heads, and they still get sick and have aches and  pains like everyone else.  And they still "die in their sins."

    What the modern day seekers of ascension are looking for - whether they realize  it or not - is the age-old quest.  Those who are not familiar with the  extensive literature don't realize that the Quest for the Holy Grail and the  Great Work of Alchemy are described in almost the same terms.  This means that  the Quest for the Holy Grail and the Work of the Alchemists hold many clues for  us as to the REAL WORK OF ASCENSION.  Repeatedly they present allegories of  struggle, deception, battles with dragons, deceivers, and evil forces of all  kinds.  The story o the Knight who slays the Dragon and rescues the Princess  from the Tower after years of seeking, struggling, suffering and overcoming, is  an allegory that is as valid to day as it was in ages past.  It is the TRUE  PATH OF ASCENSION.

    As we present the information in this volume, the reader will be introduced to  the idea that the science of the ancients may have included a very  comprehensive knowledge of the deeper reality that present day sciences,  including physics, chemistry, mathematics, and astrophysics, are only  rediscovering.  And here we do not mean the ancient Egyptians or Babylonians or  Sumerians, but rather peoples of far greater antiquity than they, and that the  Egyptians, Babylonians, Sumerians, and so on, retained only a distorted and  corrupted version of these things in the form of myths and legends which they  elaborated and utilized in their "magical practices."  Further, we propose that  it is only in the light of the present day scientific knowledge that the true  ancient knowledge, depicted in these myths and legends and religious rites can  be properly understood.  Which is not to say that we are suggesting that we  understand or have interpreted all of them.  We are only saying that there are  many things in these ancient stories that suggest the former existence of an  advanced science, that may have enabled interface between layers, or dimensions  of reality on this planet in archaic times.

    This idea is not original to us, as many readers will know.  However, we do  think that we have been able to shine a light into certain dark corners that  have been, heretofore, poorly understood.  Arthur C. Clarke pointed out, "Any  sufficiently evolved technology is indistinguishable from magic."  

    When we divest our minds of preconceived notions about what the ancients may or  may not have known, and we just look at myths and legends, the substrate of  religions, over and over again we see descriptions of activities, events, terms  and potentials that express such things as a knowledge of free energy, anti- gravity, time travel, interplanetary travel, atomic energy, atomic  molecularization and demolecularization; just a whole host of doings that are  presently understood as the wild and superstitious imaginings of howling  savages.  Today, these concepts are only beginning to be understood.

      Many scholars explain that such stories - myths and legends - were primitive  attempts to understand the environment by personifying, or anthropomorphizing,  the forces of nature.  Other interpreters make the mistake of assuming that it  was a "sacred science" in terms that strictly deny any form of material  interpretation and interpenetration.

    I gave such ideas a great deal of thought at one point, all the while observing  my five children develop, and noting how they noticed things and what they  noticed, and how they explained it to themselves and each other.  One of the  earliest observations I made about children and their reactions to their  environment was that they pretty much just accept it as it is.  They don't seem  to need "explanations" for it.  What is "out there" is what it is until some  adult repeats to them some story about it which may entertain them or frighten  them.  Until "stories" are told to them, children are intensely busy just  imitating what they see other people do, most generally the adults in their  lives.  Without fantastic tales being told to them, their games of make-believe  consist of ordinary mundane and very HUMAN dramas.  And even when they are told  magical stories about flying horses or people with super powers, they often  resist these dramas in preference for those that directly apply to their own  experience and observation.

    Perhaps the comparison of the development of a child's thinking in relation to  their environment, to the development of evolutionary thinking of human beings  in general, is not altogether appropriate, but I do think that it ought to give  us some pause to question just where and how the creation of myth and legend  actually served human beings evolutionarily speaking.  Why would anyone tell a  story about a man with magic sandals that enabled him to fly if they are merely  anthropomorphizing the forces of nature?  If it is a "magical being" such as a  "god," why does he need sandals to fly with?  He could just as easily have  wings that are part of his physical structure.  He's already a god, after all.   He's not human.  So why the sandals?  

    Indeed, there may be an "archetypal pool of ideas" from which all humanity may  draw in dreams and visions, but that leads us into realms that of thought that  do not answer the simple question as to where and how and why howling savages  were served by making up fantastic tales about the forces of nature, that  included certain elements that suggest technology and not a truly "magical  state of being?"

    In the present day, there are all sorts of "mystical" groups and organizations  that claim to be the recipients of ancient knowledge, and that this matter has  to do with what is commonly called "occultism," or the "esoteric" or magical  practices.  There is a plethora of books that purport to be scientific, but  which totally reject mainstream science in any context.  Subjects such as  sacred geometry, archaeoastronomy, new physics, have all become subjects of  fevered study in order to discern the "occult significance" of the works of the  ancients.  And invariably, it is done in strictly ephemeral terms, positing  that all of the abilities of the ancients were accomplished strictly by magical  rites or rituals.  

    Occultists claim that the mental and spiritual powers of the ancients were what  we have lost.  They then assert that this ancient wisdom was broken up and  obscured in magical doctrines which those who are not "initiated" simply cannot  grasp.  They claim that parts of it have been handed down by continuous  tradition, and released to the world at opportune times, and other parts have  only been released to an elect few, of which exalted company, they, of course,  are obviously members.

    When considering such ideas, we do come to the thought that it is very likely  that there are rites or stories or myths behind the rituals, that may, indeed,  have been passed down in such secret groups in a more pure form than the  stories that make their way around the globe across millennia.  But that does  not mean that the "priesthood" of such groups truly understand the stories or  rites of which they are guardians - especially if they do not consider the  possibility that some of such information may be strictly and purely scientific  codes and require a trained scientist to decode them.

    Most of the so-called "occultists" and "sacred geometers" remind me of David  Macaulay's "Motel Of Mysteries,22   Boston, Houghton Mifflin, 1979"a humorous  account of an archaeological excavation of a twentieth century motel, in which  everything is meticulously excavated, recorded and then totally misinterpreted.   The "vast funerary" complex unearthed by Howard Carson contains wonders such  as the "Great Altar" (Television), a statueof the deity WATT (bedside lamp) and  the Internal Component Enclosure (or ICE box).  But just misunderstanding is  not all we have to contend with.  That  there are others who seem to be part of  the very Control System we have mentioned above with what seem to be extremely  dangerous proclivities of promulgating dangerous and cunning lies is also  evident as we will discuss further on.

    In terms of archaeology, there are processes involved in the formation of the  archaeological record.  A lack of understanding of these formation processes is  not always confined to the non-professionals.  It has only relatively recently  been suggested that the archaeology of a site is not a direct record of what  went on there, but instead may have been distorted by a whole series of  processes, including cataclysmic disruption.

    We are suggesting that the same may be true regarding myths and legends and  religious rites.  They are a sort of archaeological record of the history of  mankind held in archetypal terms, buried in stories, distorted by a whole  series of processes.

    Even if some of the purported ancient schools and mystical paths have kept some  of this information intact, or in a purer state, it still seems that much has  "faded on the page" due to the long period of time since such things were part  of the consensus - thus external - reality.  But still, there are those who  have seen the contradictions in our reality and our beliefs and who have sought  in these ancient teachings to discover what might have been known.  Many of  them have made discoveries that, when considered with information from many  other fields, assists us in this essential discovery of our true condition and  purpose.

    The question naturally arises, what does the history of the subject have to  tell us about what may or may not "really work?"  Can we examine it; can we  track it and discover not only the obstacles of the process, but also the REAL  BENEFITS that might accrue to the Seeker?  Can we track and discover the  apparent abilities that are the SIGNS of accomplishment of the successful  Quest?

    In short, what is the REAL Philosophers Stone?  What can the Hero really  accomplish when he finds the Holy Grail?

    > Meantime I would just like to add that there was a time in my life when

    > I would not have understood or known how to understand the way you

    > approach this. 

    One thing Mouravieff wrote that was powerfully meaningful to me was his series  of comments on the "type" of the Knight - who is already well-developed  emotionally, but really needs to work on the intellectual part.  The fact is  this: even though my husband and myself are considered to be "intellectuals"  and to have pursued intellectual development all our lives, what became  excruciatingly clear was that it was very one-sided in some respects.  Because  of what Mouravieff calls the "A" influences - and we just call it the Matrix  Control System - our EMOTIONS were distorted to only allow us to accept ideas  that were emotionally pleasing - even if they were of a high intellectual sort. 

     All of this has to do with what Mouravieff suggests is the "matter of  matters," i.e. "evil."  And that, of course, takes us to the many ideas of  "fixing" the world, or "saving" the world, or whatever.  In other words, what  amounts to hubris - deciding that the ideas that a person has about good and  evil based on human intellectualizations - must be enforced on creation.

    What I finally realized - in a period of intense initiation - was that God has  Many faces - not all of them pleasant to behold.  And, at that point, I SAW the  "Matrix," and I SAW the "A" influences and "B" influences, and that the REAL  work of this level of being is to CHOOSE one's alignment with one or the other,  and then to begin the process of discerning and "assimilating."  This is why  everything is "masked" in symbols.  This reality is, in a sense, the landscape  of the Quest for the Grail.   It is a TEST.  

    But more is needed, as Mouravieff points out.  One must, at some point, DO  something.  And this is where faith comes in.  It is not "faith" in the sense  of a "belief," but Faith in the REALITY of higher things... and it requires the  individual to essentially "step off a cliff" at the edge of the Matrix reality  into the reality of the REAL.  

    I did.

    And just as the alchemists describe it, such an act results in the "death" of  something - and the physical body - so attuned to the "A" influences - being  forcibly disconnected from them via WILL - goes through some of the most  horrible sufferings imaginable.  It could be said to be similar to drug  withdrawal in a sense, but a LOT worse.  In physical terms, an infection took  hold in my body affecting my eyes, ears, and lungs.  I literally wept blood.   For days I lay there, almost unable to breathe, with compresses on my eyes,  medications in my ears, ingesting the massive doses of the most powerful  antibiotics available that had no effect - and I did NOT relent.  I KNEW that  what I was experiencing was the efforts of the "agents of the Matrix" to turn  me aside from my resolve.  And I just kept affirming that "you can kill me if  you like, but I am NOT changing my course."

    And at some point, there was a "shift" and the forces withdrew.

    Ark "found me" 40 days later.  To the day.  

    Now, I have to tell you that this process of being brought to the point of  SEEING was facilitated in a gentle, but firm way by these "Cassiopaeans."  In  fact, looking back over my life in retrospect, I can perceive the influence  from the time of my birth - always there in the background watching over me,  waiting for me to "ask the question."  And when at last, in 1984, I was brought  to that point of bankruptcy - another period of serious illness - the  communication began in a direct way - I would ask the question mentally, and  just wait in a meditative state - and it would begin to flow as just "ideas"  which I would write down.  

    Well, because of the fact that my emotional nature has repeatedly led me into  traps - I already knew that my "machine tolerances" had to be analyzed and  adjusted.  I knew that I had to do research to ensure that what I was  "receiving" was not just more and better disinformation, so to say.

    And so, over the next ten years I did research... and it was during this  research that I came to the idea that, for me to be able to be objective about  things - more of the "adjustment of the machine" - the mode of transmission  really needed to be modified so that the thoughts bypassed my conscious mind.   And so, the two years of developing the circuit for the transmissions via the  board and planchette.  

    Yes, it is unusual.  But for me - knowing my own nature - that of  susceptibility to manipulation because the Love nature in me is so developed    and this energy was so  easily stolen, and manipulated by "agents" - it was a  necessary step.  

    Of course, meeting Ark was an event that was utterly stupendous.  It resulted  in all kinds of "effects" that I try to describe, but words fail.  Some of  these actually included bilocation.  

    Now, lest you think that is a little crazy, I want to point out that Ark is a  30 year career scientist.  At the time he "found me," having been on his own  quest for all his life as well, he had "put away" his dreams and was  functioning as the Director of the Department of Nonlinear Dynamics and Complex  Systems at the Institute for Theoretical Physics, University of Wroclaw,  Poland.  How he dealt with this "activation" of circuits and potentials that  had been suppressed for years is a story in itself.  Some of it is even rather  humorous now, when we look back.  Especially when a man who has convinced  himself that he is a "linear thinker" sees his "other half" come in a window  while she is physically 5,000 miles away.

    At that moment, I had fallen into a spontaneous "trance," so to say - something  that has almost never happened - and I was struggling to maintain my awareness.   I would force my eyes open to observe the environment, and what I saw was  LIVING LIGHT.  Meanwhile, some part of me had apparently decided to take a  little stroll across the Atlantic.

    This occurred several more times during this "readjustment of frequencies"  stage, and was always followed by a baffling period of intense cold where my  teeth would chatter and my body would ache just as if I were freezing.   Thankfully, I found an exact description of this process in the works of Ibn al- 'Arabi, which he calls a "descent."  Based on his description, it is a  temporary "seating" of the higher centers IN THE BODY for the purpose of  "bestowal" of qualities.  I sort of think of it as my higher self as the  "computer hardware repairman" who cam to make some serious adjustments in my  circuitry. Al-'Arabi points out that when the "angel," as he calls it,  withdraws, the individual, having been in a "state" of super-accelerated  vibration - which manifests as heat (and boy, was it HOT!) - then feels the  normal condition as intensely cold and cannot get warm by any human means and  must simply wait for the vibrations of the body to catch up with the vibrations  of the newly bestowed "station."  

    I was very relieved to read this.  And again, it was exactly right for me to  read it AFTER experiencing it so that I would not doubt my experience and think  that I had "manifested" it due to emotional thinking.

    This is also why it was exactly right, after going through the past year of  "trial by fire" that Mouravieff should become the new piece of the puzzle -  only AFTER the experiences he describes.  This is what convinces me of the fact  that he has brought to us a major piece of the puzzle.  There is NO possibility  that anything that has occurred in the past years was "suggested" to me by  reading his material beforehand, and the events are described by him in detail -  exactly as they happened.  In short, it further strengthens my HOPE that we  CAN "DO" something.  And I must say that, like you, I was losing my hope in the  course of the seemingly endless struggle.

    Because, of course, our struggle has been enormous, probably based on the fact  that we have "gone public" and have made some significant ripples in the  "Matrix."  And frankly, I do NOT think that anyone could do it without a  "living Tradition" such as the C's - because we always have guidance - even if  sometimes it is rather cryptic due to the non-violation of learning directive.   If not for their assurances that this relentless attack was the "fire" from  which would come "light," we would have just given up any public work at all.   The attacks, the liars and defamers, spreaders of "scandal" and odious and  sickening acts of purely filthy libel - attacks on our children even - were  utterly horrendous.  

    But we survived, we passed that test, daily turning the negative emotions into  "light" and giving it out to the world.  

    And Mouravieff was the "gift" that came after.

    And what a gift it is.

    >Any idea I 

    > had that nothing was true unless I could explain it has long ago been

    Oh, indeed.  But now, perhaps, you know better what we have done so far... you  start with faith that there IS Truth "out there."  You evaluate your own being  and determine how best to find out what is or is not truth - that's research -  after a period of that, which is the "collecting of "A" influences," as well as  a repeated series of shocks when you discover that what you may have believed  as true is NOT true... this begins to "fuse" the magnetic center.  

    After a period of that, once you get down to some of the most fundamental lies  in which you believed, and you are mightily shocked to have to make the choice  to give them up, or go back to sleep in the lies. 

     THEN you realize that Truth leads to action.  This action results in another  major shock - and that takes you over into a sort of "space" that is sort of an  "interval."  Hopefully, you have enough will to sustain yourself there... and  if so, you land on the next "note" which is essentially, a different "world."   And in THAT world, polar beings find each other.  And in that world, you find  hope.

    But again, hope is nurtured by knowledge - by research... and so, at this new  level of being, you continue... 

    And there we are.  And now, we see more light at the end of the tunnel.  That  hope is growing.

Commentary on Boris Mouravieff's Gnosis

As things "heat up" here on the Big Blue Marble, we have received much correspondence from individuals asking "what to do." The subject has even come up a number of times in the egroup discussions, and many of the old fears and turmoil have surfaced with ideas of pulling up roots and - for reasons of self-preservation - moving here or there or undertaking to follow this or that promoter of "methods of ascension" or methods of "fixing the planet" so that everybody can just "get along" or we can all snuggle up with some warm fuzzies and get some rest.

The reader who has surveyed the material on this site has surely come to the conclusion that what we are saying is "nothing is as it seems and never has been," including the many religions and "methods of ascension" promoted down through the ages.

But what is lacking is a clearly defined WAY that might give guidance to the seeker in his quest for the keys to his own "salvation" in whatever terms he might define it. I have worked on presenting the WAY in both the Wave Series and the Adventures series by sharing my own experiences and what I have gleaned from much study and research, but some readers are put off by material that deals with all the lies and deceptions that we face in our reality and simply want to read something "uplifting." It doesn't seem to occur to them that one cannot be "uplifted" as long as one is mired in quicksand. What seems to be true is that we live in a world of lies - ruled by lies and stealing - and that human beings lie because it is impossible for them to do otherwise. Without a Way, that is.

As a result of our own searching and questing for answers, the repeated trying and testing of sources and materials, little by little we have come to the idea of what NOT to do. But again, there has not been a whole lot about what TO DO.

The Cassiopaeans have indicated certain pathways to follow, but as always, we are more or less on our own in acquiring the knowledge and learning how to apply it - and for good reason, as the reader may know.

In recent months however, we have been surveying a body of teachings that not only meshes with, but vigorously expands upon the Cassiopaean Transmissions to an extent that we cannot think that it is accidental. In fact, the overlapping and "filling in the gaps" quality of this work is so astounding that we are certain that the Cassiopaeans themselves are very likely involved in this teaching in ways we do not understand.

The work in question is that of the Russian exile Boris Mouravieff, presented in his three part study and commentaries entitled Gnosis. Very little information is available on the background of these materials while a good deal of disinformation is circulating in other circles, and it is best to address these problems before we even attempt to present the material.

As it happens, during our research into Boris M., we discovered that he was being soundly lambasted by William Patrick Patterson in his book "Talking With the Left Hand" in which he accuses Mouravieff of "stealing" his ideas from Gurdjieff. Patterson is the author of four highly praised books on spiritual development and is a longtime student of John Pentland, the man Gurdjieff chose to lead the Gurdjieff Work in America, and the editor of The Gurdjieff Journal©, the only international quarterly devoted to exploring the "ancient teaching of the Fourth way brought and embodied by G. I. Gurdjieff."

Just in case the reader is not familiar with Gurdjieff, let me give a little background. Dating from his first lectures in Moscow and St. Petersburg in 1912, George Ivanovich Gurdjieff attracted the attention of occultists and many Western aristocrats. His teachings (often referred to as the 'Gurdjieff Work' or 'Fourth Way') became widely known through the writings and lectures of his pupil, the famous Russian mathematician and journalist Pyotr D. Ouspensky, and were later propagated by Alfred Orage, John G. Bennett, Rodney Collins, and Dr. Maurice Nicoll.

Gurdjieff himself admitted that he was utilizing 'stolen' teachings from a wide range of groups that he had encountered (including the Yezidis, the Russian Orthodox Church, and Sufi 'Bektashi' and 'Naqshbandi' sects in the Hindu Kush and Pamir regions) in his world travels. A deep study of Gurdjieff's work shows that he was obviously experimenting with his own ideas on how to utilize bits and pieces from these different teachings to create a system that would enable individuals to overcome ingrained "cognitive defects," become more conscious, and awaken the Higher Self's "Objective Conscience."

At a certain point, it seems that Gurdjieff realized that he had undertaken an impossible task since nearly all of his students "heard" only what they wanted to hear. He closed his school and concentrated on putting his ideas into allegory in his book Beelzebub's Tales To His Grandson (1950), which also incorporated and developed additional esoteric themes into his ideas.

Many of Gurdjieff's concepts have profoundly influenced our present culture due to the fact that some of his followers were famous and wealthy and had the means to promote them to others in the upper classes. After his death in 1949, Gurdjieff's legacy was disseminated through many people, and much of his work has been passed on through fragmentation of the many groups into something akin to secular denominations. One of the biggest problems with what happened to Gurdjieff's work - what seemed to be a sincere attempt to help humanity - was further obscured by the formation of what can only be called personality cults and identifications with Gurdjieff at the expense of his ideas. It seems that Gurdjieff himself saw this coming at the end of his life.

Groups that are offshoots of Gurdjieff's teachings have been known to use all kinds of things to reprogram their members, including isolation, group think, authoritarian power structures, and other psychological methods designed to unmask or break down the personal ego. But, what seems clear is that, in the case of Gurdjieff, no one group can claim the whole cheese since he was curiously selective about what he told whom, and even those who were closest to him obviously misunderstood what he was trying to convey, as evidenced by his own statements about this factor towards the end of his life.

Mouravieff tells us:

    People interested in esoteric matters will probably have read the book by P.D. Ouspensky, published posthumously, titled "In Search of the Miraculous: Fragments of an Unknown Teaching."  The ideas in that book were presented to Ouspensky by Georges Gurdjieff.  Gurdjieff indicates the basis of his teaching: "for the benefit of those who know already, I will say that, if you like, this is esoteric Christianity."

    Ouspensky's book - correctly indicated by the title - contains only fragments of a tradition which, until recently, was only transmitted orally.  And only a study of the complete tradition can give access to the revelation.  The system disclosed by the fragments that form Ouspensky's book and Gurdjieff's work, originates from revelations issued by the Great Esoteric Brotherhood to which the Apostle Paul alluded in his Epistle to the Romans: 

        We are assured and know that all things work together and are fitting into a plan for good to and for those who love God and are called according to design and purpose.  For those whom He foreknew, He also destined from the beginning to be molded into the image of His Son, that he might become the firstborn of MANY brethren.  And those whom He thus foreordained, He also called; and those whom He called, He also justified, made them righteous, and those whom He justified, He also glorified.

        What then shall we say to this:  If God is for us, who can be against us? [8;28-31]

    Boris Mouravieff asks: What should be the attitude of students towards the "Gurdjieff phenomenon" and Ouspensky's "Fragments"?

    The attentive reader will easily find the answer to that question himself in the contents of this article: we must begin by separating the message from the messenger, and we must look for the message beyond the level or information. This is the way to discover and eliminate error.

    In a myth well known in the Orient we are told that there exists a race of 'Royal Swans'. The fable adds that if we put milk mixed with water in front of one of them, it will separate out the milk and drink it, leaving the water. That must be the attitude of students.

        "Saint Gregory Palamas said the same when he wrote in his first Triad: "As for those people they call ‘theologians’ or ‘teachers,’ and think themselves able to borrow their theological terms, is it necessary even to mention them? Is it necessary that we keep away from "the light which lights every man who comes into the world," and wait for the terrible shadows of ignorance to illumine us, on the pretext that, just as serpents are useful, this is something useful for us? For the flesh of serpents is only useful to us if they have been killed, and cut up and used with reason as a remedy against their own bites. Those who kill them in this way turn a part of these snakes against themselves, just as if they had killed with his own sword a new Goliath, who had taken arms, who had set himself up to oppose us, who cursed the army of the living God - someone educated in divine things by sinners and illiterates."

The fact is, Gurdjieff faced great difficulties at the point in time when he sought to experiment with waking up humanity. As noted above, it was "Mission Impossible." However, what he and his followers did manage to do was to slash a trail through a jungle of lies and disinformation. It is not appropriate for his followers to insist that this bare trail is all there is and that there is no more. Rather, it is only logical to widen the trail, to pass through the gate revealed at the end of the trail, and discover what lies on the other side.

    "Lastly," said Mouravieff, "let those who have profited and are still profiting from the 'message' be sincerely grateful to the messenger and to the one who interpreted it. If they know how, let them pray for the salvation of their souls."

Nevertheless, William Patrick Patterson has penned rather harsh and unseemly accusations against Mouravieff - rather similar to our own experiences with Maynerd Most and Alvin Wiley - that need to be addressed. As it happens, a student of Mouravieff has done precisely that in an article entitled A response to William Patrick Patterson's criticism in his book "Taking with the Left Hand" by a student of Boris Mouravieff, Translated from the French by Theodore J. Nottingham, from which the following is excerpted:

    Patterson fails to bring forth the least fact, the least witness, the least clue, the least element of proof. He only states an opinion, his own, considering it of sufficient weightiness to confuse it with the truth.

    When Patterson writes: "Mouravieff's negative judgment of Gurdjieff rests on...the perception...Gurdjieff stole the teaching", the statement suggests that this is Mouravieff's perception, a purely subjective assumption leading to a serious accusation: stealing.

    In fact, Mouravieff reports the admission from Gurdjieff himself. He brings a testimonial and it is the testimonial of an admission. The minimal space given to this fact can be compared to the long developments which Patterson devotes to his own assumptions. On one side an admission, on the other suppositions. To which does Patterson give more attention? [...]

    Patterson's attitude reveals a classic psychological process. We can see several aspects of this: The first aspect is evoked by Patterson himself: "the projection onto the teacher". Indeed, it seems that certain individuals cannot approach the Knowledge without associating a name or a face to it. They "personalize" that which, in essence, is beyond all personalizing; and then emotion surpasses thought, that is, intelligence. [...] They focus their attention on the messenger instead of the message. This personalizing can take the acute form of veneration, not to say idolatry. Then, all questioning of their idol, even in the name of truth, is judged iconoclastic. The "blasphemer" must be punished -- that is, invalidated -- so that the worship of the idol may continue.

    The second aspect: he who identifies with the messenger finds himself inevitably wounded by the "attacks" (as they see them) against the idol. His personality, cut to the quick, will react. Pushed on by Nature -- which refuses all suffering -- it will fall back on the "self-tranquilizing machine".

    We know that, among the means used by the self-tranquilizing machine, there are two primary ones: the first is sentimentality toward oneself, self-pity, the second is accusation of the other. Each of these attitudes -- or both together as they generally form an "infernal couple" -- will calm, place a balm on the wound. And this will occur to the detriment of truth, replaced by justifications and rationalizations calling upon imagination whenever necessary. [...]

    This approach is close to being in bad faith, for instance in suggesting that Gnosis is "verbiage and lack of clarity and comprehension on the part of Mouravieff". This is proven wrong by many readers who "have commented on the clarity of the text" (preface of Gnosis II).

I would like to add here that we most thoroughly agree that Mouravieff's work is extraordinary in its clarity and completion of what was started by Gurdjieff, explaining much that Gurdjieff never explained, or if he did, those he explained it to either did not understand it, or sought to keep it secret so as to dispense it in controlled dollops to those they considered worthy (or who had enough money to pay for it.) Mouravieff's student goes on to say:

    He writes (without any proof by the way): "Mouravieff, an exiled aristocrat, had the typical sense of superiority over Russian émigrés he presumed to be socially inferior." "An aristocrat, intellectual and moralist, Mouravieff no doubt had trouble with Gurdjieff's unconventional behavior." It seems that Patterson could not imagine any other criteria to perceive others than through their social circumstances, as if a person could be reduced to a caricature.

    Patterson criticizes Mouravieff for stripping "Gurdjieff's teaching of its mooring in sacred science and insert it into an Eastern Orthodox Christian perspective..." And he adds peremptorily: "The two teachings simply didn't fit together."

I would like to note here that the work of Mouravieff provides that ineluctable bridge between the works of Gurdjieff, Ibn al-'Arabi, Carlos Casteneda, conjectured esoteric Christianity, hermeticism/alchemy and the Cassiopaeans. It should be noted that the Cassiopaeans have definitively supported the existence and work of a man around whom the Jesus legend formed - though they tell us that the story in the Bible that is supposed to be history is a myth - and here we find a body of teachings that lends background to this view, as well as supplemental information that elucidates the many clues offered by the Cassiopaeans. In our opinion, it is not only precipitate to reject Mouravieff's work, it is possibly suicidal. The comments of Mouravieff's student continue:

    And yet...! Is not the System of Octaves symbolized by the musical scale (tones and semitones) as well as by the notes that compose it (Dominus, Sidereus orbis, etc...). Is not the origin of these notes a Christian hymn to John the Baptist? Mouravieff reminds us of this in detail (Gnosis, chapter 10). He therefore responds, in preventive measure, to the issues raised by Patterson by showing that Christianity, including its European version, contained the System of Octaves at a certain period.

    Going back through Christianity to Judaism, Mouravieff points out the presence of the System in David's Psalm 118. Finally, there is no question that the Philokalia contains all the precepts of the Work and its "Christianity" need not be proven...

    Besides, Gurdjieff himself -- as Mouravieff reminds us -- made reference rather often to both monasteries and to Christian esotericism. And, other than questioning Mouravieff's witness -- that is, to call him a liar -- Gurdjieff stated to him that [Gurdjieff's] System "was the ABC of Christian doctrine".

    Mouravieff himself tells us that he learned the System "in 1920-21" in Constantinople through Ouspensky and Gurdjieff. This does not mean that Mouravieff did not follow other teachings, "Christian" teachings for example (see references in the manuscript INITIATION). On this last point, having no information, we can only ask questions: Did Mouravieff have Christian masters? Did they know the System? Or did Mouravieff study for himself "monuments such as the Philokalia", and discovered on his own the keys to the Gospels from Psalm 118?

    It would be an exceptional exploit of a self-taught person in a field where everyone claims the importance of an oral tradition.

    In saying that Ouspensky had "never been initiated in the oral Tradition other than through Gurdjieff", Mouravieff suggests that he personally had access to this oral Tradition among confirmed masters. But this can only be a deduction, based on our crediting the honesty of Mouravieff; there is no "objective" certainty.

    Whatever the case may be, we come out of these conjectures with the observation, which is now entirely objective, that Gnosis contains more information then [Ouspensky's] Fragments. Mouravieff evaluated the volume of supplementary material in Gnosis at one third more than those contained in Ouspensky's Fragments.

    How can Patterson explain that the copier knows more than the one copied, that the thief is richer than the one who is robbed?

    Certainly, one should analyze the nature of this additional material contained in Gnosis. Are these traditional teachings or ideas belonging to Mouravieff? It is also possible that Ouspensky, or his inheritors, did not reveal everything in Fragments.

    But Patterson does not mention the objective fact that Gnosis completes Ouspensky's revelations. Ouspensky's fragmentary message becomes, thanks to Mouravieff, an enlarged message "in the strict limits which are necessary and sufficient to enable the student to go further and in depth through his own creative efforts."

    Gurdjieff never clearly announced his goal: "I certainly have a goal...but my goal cannot mean anything to you at this time." What Gurdjieff does not reveal, Patterson miraculously knows and can confide to us: "Gurdjieff's mission was to establish the ancient teaching of the Fourth Way in the West as quickly as possible."

    On the other hand, what Patterson does not tell us is by whom was this mission given and in what way Gurdjieff was predisposed to accomplish it. Mouravieff does present certain unfortunate predispositions [about Gurdjieff] which are not favorable to the accomplishment of Gurdjieff's supposed mission:

        1) Gurdjieff is more the "sorcerer" type (hypnotist) than the teacher in the tradition of Socrates. Considering his type, his teaching activity was in great risk of being contaminated and parasited by the hypnotic influence that he "automatically" exerted over people.

        2) According to Mouravieff, Gurdjieff did not possess the intellectual talent to structure and shape the teaching. He had to rely on an intermediary -- Ouspensky. Mouravieff also has reservations on the oral expression [of Gurdjieff] which was sometimes brutal and insulting.

    Why did Gurdjieff hide his sources? Why does he remain silent on this subject, except in rare exceptional circumstances, such as that encounter with Mouravieff at the Cafe de la Paix: "I find the system at the foundations of the Christian doctrine. What do you say on this matter?" [asked Mouravieff of Gurdjieff]-- "It is the ABC," Gurdjieff answered me. "But they do not understand this!"

    Gurdjieff's silence regarding his sources gives birth to a suspicion: he is silent for a reason, because he follows a purely personal goal. This is the very opposite to the accomplishment of a mission. Why would one who fulfills a mission hide his sources? [A response to William Patrick Patterson's criticism in his book "Taking with the Left Hand" by a student of Boris Mouravieff Translated from the French by Theodore J. Nottingham]

In his book, Struggle of the Magicians, Patterson includes quotes on the front pages which say:

    The Magus is the highest that man can approach to God. G.I. Gurdjieff

    Toast to Gurdjieff: God give you the strength and the manhood to endure your lofty solitude. Rachmilevitch

    Gurdjieff is a kind of walking God - a planetary or even solar God. A.R. Orage

In response to these ideas, obviously dear to the heart of many Gurdjieff followers, including Patterson, let me just point out that Gurdjieff never accomplished the transmutation. He died just like everybody else.

Considering the fact that several other "seekers" were reputed to have transitioned without seeing death - Flamel and Fulcanelli among them - we might think that the only parts of Gurdjieff's work that should interest us are the parts that elucidate the work of the affirmed Masters. And frankly, Mouravieff has offered many clues that do, in fact, contribute to the body of alchemical/hermetic knowledge in a significant way.

So, in reading these many sources and comparing, we do have some chance of discerning the gems caught between the cracks in the pavement. Patterson has done himself and all other seekers a great disservice in his attacks on Mouravieff.

One of the things that really struck me when doing the research on Mouravieff was the following remark from the pages of the group - Praxis - that is promoting his books:

    The course studies the Christian Gnosis of Boris Mouravieff, exiled at the time of the Russian Revolution, who was a little-known 'third man' who before and after WWII, and taught and practiced the Fourth Way in its original Christian form.

This raised the hair on my head not only because of all the material I had found in Mouravieff's work that echoed the words of the Cassiopaeans, but because of the remark they had once made:

    07-19-97
    A: Laura, my dear, if you really want to reveal "many beautiful and amazing things," all you need to do is remember the triad, the trilogy, the trinity, and look always for the triplicative connecting clue profile. Connect the threes... do not rest until you have found three beautifully balancing meanings!!
    Q: So, in everything there are three aspects?
    A: And why? Because it is the realm of the three that you occupy. In order to possess the keys to the next level, just master the Third Man Theme, then move on with grace and anticipation.

And I can guarantee the reader that Mouravieff presents the keys to move on to the next level.

This brings us back to the issue of what we are supposed to DO in this day and age that is getting scarier by the minute. When I was at that stage myself, asking where should we do and what should we do, I was quite surprised when the C's responded that all of the running around to look for "safe places" was just "3D thinking" and that the only thing that counted was:

    "Who you are and WHAT YOU SEE."

This was expanded with a question about what are the lessons of 3D that we need to learn to "graduate" to 4 D:

    Q: (L) Well, how in the heck am I supposed to get there [graduate to 4th Density] if I can't "get it?"
    A: Who says you have to "get it" before you get there?
    Q: (L) Well, that leads back to: what is the wave going to do to expand this awareness? Because, if the wave is what "gets you there," what makes this so?
    A: No. It is like this: After you have completed all your lessons in "third grade," where do you go?
    Q: (L) So, it is a question of...
    A: Answer, please.
    Q: (L) You go to fourth grade.
    A: Okay, now, do you have to already be in 4th grade in order to be allowed to go there? Answer.
    Q: (L) No. But you have to know all the 3rd density things...
    A: Yes. More apropos: you have to have learned all of the lessons.
    Q: (L) What kind of lessons are we talking about here?
    A: Karmic and simple understandings.
    Q: (L) What are the key elements of these understandings, and are they fairly universal?
    A: They are universal.
    Q: (L) What are they?
    A: We cannot tell you that.
    Q: (L) Do they have to do with discovering the MEANINGS of the symbology of 3rd density existence, seeing behind the veil... and reacting to things according to choice? Giving each thing or person or event its due? [As the Sufis teach.]
    A: Okay. But you cannot force the issue. When you have learned, you have learned!

Curiously, this issue of what the individual can SEE was brought up in another context - that of discerning the character of very negative forces in our reality:

    Q: (L) Okay. Bundy described his murdering urges as a "pressure building inside" him that he couldn't overcome, and it seemed to cause him to stop being "human," as we think of it. That seems to me to be an example of an implant being able to overcome a person's social behavior, or controls over antisocial tendencies. Is this also what happened to the person who killed JO?
    A: Maybe.
    Q: (L) Is there a connection between the newly missing girl, CB, and JO?
    A: You are doing well in your probing of the knowledge within on this issue, we suggest continuance, after all, learning is fun!
    Q: (L) So, it seems to me that there was a connection between the appearance of CB and JO. Could it be that the individual who killed one or both of them was programmed to respond to this particular type facial characteristic? Could that be part of the programming?
    A: End subject.
    Q: (L) What do you mean?
    A: We have helped you all that is necessary for now on this matter. It is beneficial for you to continue on your own for growth.
    Q: (L) Can I ask just one or two more LITTLE questions in a different direction? I mean, this is like walking away and leaving me in the dark!
    A: No it is not!
    Q: (L) I would like to be able to solve this because the families are in pain and have asked for help.
    A: Why don't you trust your incredible abilities? If we answer for you now, you will be helpless when it becomes necessary for you to perform this function on a regular basis, as it will be!!!!
    Q: (L) Well, frankly, I don't want to be involved in any more murder investigations. It is too upsetting. Am I supposed to DO this sort of thing regularly???
    A: Not same arena.
    Q: (L) Well, then how do you mean "perform this function?"
    A: No, seeing the unseen.

I would like to ask the reader to please note that the C's indicated that "seeing the unseen" would be a necessary function and that being unable to do it would leave me (and anybody else on the path!) "helpless." This takes us back to "who you are and what you SEE," and leads to another important point:

    C's: Beware of disinformation. It diverts your attention away from reality thus leaving you open to capture and conquest and even possible destruction. Disinformation comes from seemingly reliable sources. It is extremely important for you to not gather false knowledge as it is more damaging than no knowledge at all. Remember knowledge protects, ignorance endangers. The information you speak of, Terry, was given to you deliberately because you and Jan and others have been targeted due to your intense interest in level of density 4 through 7 subject matter. You have already been documented as a "threat." [...] Remember, disinformation is very effective when delivered by highly trained sources because hypnotic and transdimensional techniques are used thereby causing electronic anomalies to follow suggestion causing perceived confirmation to occur.

So, let's get on with it: learning to See the Unseen with the help of the work of Mouravieff.

In the following sections, I will be quoting heavily from Mouravieff's books, including the introductions, but often with the insertion of "modern terms" at certain points, or terms which will make the excerpts more comprehensible to those who have not delved deeply into such studies. It is my hope that this condensation will inspire the readers to not only read the works of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky and Mouravieff, but that it will provide a broader framework for understanding the many articles and sessions files of Cassiopaean Transmissions published on this website.

    Boris Mouravieff's trilogy "Gnosis," is an attempt to recover and describe, in terms understandable to modern man, a particular Tradition handed down over the centuries, in a sometimes broken line, but one that still exists today in the Eastern Orthodox Church.  This tradition could be said to be the Christian equivalent of Yoga, Zen, and the other inner traditions of the far Eastern religions, disciplines, which have each existed as specializations within the religion of which they are a part.

    It is not one man's system or invention, but has its roots far back in the history of Christianity - whose roots lie in certain statements of St. Paul, and perhaps even of Christ himself.  Their development can be traced first through formative figures of the early churches, and it clearly relates to the doctrines expressed in the key texts of Eastern spirituality such as the Philokalia.

    It clearly relates the oral tradition known as the Royal Way that survives to this day in the main centers of monasticism in the Eastern church.  But it does not claim to be a work of Orthodox theology, nor to reinterpret Orthodox doctrine.

    Mouravieff admits that the survival of this tradition within the church is tenuous, that the doctrine does not appear to survive in full or has not been collected together in full.  Monks on Athos admit the existence of the Tradition but say that it has never been fully spelled out in writing.  The importance of Mouravieff's work is the effort he has made to collect that dispersed information and to make it accessible in practical form.

    What are the sources of Mouravieff's knowledge?  It is clear that his text consists of knowledge of a high order.

    There are several ways in which the accuracy of a text can be verified, and Mouravieff's stands up to all these methods of assay.  First of all, it fits the Orthodox tradition as expressed by those who still possess the Royal Way.  It evokes the confirmation of inspiration described in Plato's seventh letter.  It predicts, in what appears at first to be mere theory, the actual events of the life in the study of Gnosis.  It stands the test of practice, and in doing so it remains internally consistent.  When it does introduce ideas from other traditions, such as the concept of karma, it does so in ways that, properly understood, remain consistent to the overall statement of the doctrine with a degree of precision equal to that of the mature external sciences.

    Those who can discriminate between different levels of knowledge will find in Mouravieff and almost inexhaustible treasury of knowledge that can lead to true spiritual transformation.  But it is necessary first to work for this discrimination.  Without it, not only will you be unable to differentiate between gnosis and its imitations, but even Mouravieff's work will not release its gnosis to you in trust.

    The idea of esotericism is often misunderstood.  The clue can be found in the Gospel of Saint John:  "I am the vine, ye are the branches: he that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing."

    The word translated "without," the Greek "choris," quite definitely means "outside."  What this means is that in those times there was an inner knowledge, based on assenting to traditional knowledge - gnosis - which is then confirmed experimentally through techniques of inner observation, and a purely external kind of knowledge, gained through the ordinary senses.

    Constantine Cavarnos confirmed that there is an exoteric and esoteric Christianity:

    "The first kind of philosophy, external philosophy, comprises for them ancient Greek philosophy and the pagan philosophy of early Christian centuries.  The second kind, "internal philosophy," is identical with the [true] Christian religion." [The Hellenic Christian Philosophical Tradition," Institute for Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies, Belmont, MA, 1989. p. 109, quoted in the introduction to Mouravieff's "Gnosis II]

    Over the years, this esotericism has formed a Tradition, a science, or discipline of knowledge which may have existed before the time of Christ, but which has since been totally assimilated to the inner meaning of Christianity.  Boris Mouravieff says that "This Tradition, which in Antiquity was only revealed in the Mysteries under the seal of absolute secrecy." 

Under the influence of self-proclaimed initiates of The Tradition such as Guenon and Schwaller, Mouravieff has unfortunately adopted the idea that this Tradition passed from Egypt to Judaea and thus to Christianity. However what is clear is that the True Tradition of the Eleusinian mysteries is behind Christianity, and it was the Egyptian Tradition that became the false teaching that corrupted and distorted the work of the man we have come to know as Jesus. It is only in more recent times, with much additional research, including that of Pincknett and Prince in The Stargate Conspiracy, that we are even able to separate these threads and come to this understanding. So, Mouravieff cannot be criticized on this score.

In Manly Hall's exhaustive compendium, The Secret Teachings of All Ages, we find mention of the fact that St. Irenaeus was complaining about the efforts to compare Christianity to the religion of the Egyptians which included the death and resurrection of Osiris/Horus.  Irenaeus had some other interesting things to say about this, as Hall points out:

    "According to popular conception, Jesus was crucified during the thirty-third year of His life and in the third year of His ministry following his baptism. About AD 180, St. Irenaeus, Bishop of Lyons, one of the most eminent of the ante-Nicene theologians, wrote Against Heresies, an attack on the doctrines of the Gnostics. In this work, Irenaeus declared upon the authority of the Apostles themselves that Jesus lived to old age. To quote:

        'They, however, that they may establish their false opinion regarding that which is written, maintain that He preached for one year only, and then suffered in the twelfth month. [In speaking thus], they are forgetful of their own disadvantage, destroying His whole work, and robbing Him of that age which is both more necessary and more honourable than any other, that more advanced age, I mean, during which also as a teacher He excelled all others. For how could He have had His disciples, if He did not teach? And how could He have taught unless He had reached the age of a Master?

        For when He came to be baptised, He had not yet completed His thirtieth year, but was beginning to be about thirty years of age; and, according to these men, He preached only one year reckoning from His baptism. On completing His thirtieth year He suffered, being in fact still a young man, and who had by no means attained to advanced age.

        Now, that the first stage of early life embraces thirty years, and that this extends onward to the fortieth year, every one will admit; but from the fortieth and fiftieth year a man begins to decline towards old age, which Our Lord possessed while He still fulfilled the office of a Teacher, even as the Gospel and all the elders testify; those who were conversant in Asia with John, the disciple of the Lord, affirming that John conveyed to them that information. And He remained among them up to the time of Trajan.

        Some of them, moreover, saw not only John, but the other apostles also, and heard the very same account from them, and bear testimony as to the validity of the statement. Whom then should we rather believe? Whether such men as these or Ptolemaeus, who never saw the apostles, and who never even in his dreams attained to the slightest trace of an apostle?"

Well, obviously, this "Gospel" that Irenaeus refers to as testifying that Jesus did not suffer and die has disappeared! It could be among those of the library of Nag Hammadi. But, commenting on the foregoing passage, theologian Godfrey Higgins remarks that it has fortunately escaped the hands of those destroyers who have attempted to render the Gospel narratives consistent by deleting all such statements. He also notes that the doctrine of the crucifixion was a vexata questio among Christians even during the second century.

    "The evidence of Irenaeus, " he says, "cannot be touched. On every principle of sound criticism, and of the doctrine of probabilities, it is unimpeachable." [Anacalypsis, Godfrey Higgins, London, 1836, quoted by Manly P. Hall]

The fad for all things "Egyptian" has been with us for a very long time.  Schwaller de Lubicz - the vector of many of these ideas - settled in Egypt in 1938 and for the next 15 years studied the symbolism of the temples, particularly Luxor, finding what he considered to be proof that the ancient Egyptians were the ultimate examples of Synarchy, because the were ruled by a group of elite initiates.  He failed to point out that the Egyptian civilization was static and limited.  What's more, it caved in on itself, and never managed to produce any significant work of benefit for humanity, as Otto Neugebauer showed conclusively in his "The Exact Sciences in Antiquity."

The open-minded thinker ought to really consider the purported mysteries of Egypt in terms of the fact that they were so ignorant that they devoted a huge amount of energy to their "cult of the dead."  The whole Egyptian shtick is focused around preserving dead flesh for future or otherworldly reanimation.  The very fact that there are so many of these dead bodies for Egyptologists to dig up is the clearest evidence that the Egyptian beliefs were nonsense.

The whole issue of the excitement over Egyptian civilization is the belief that they had some power to control the forces of life because they built the pyramids and we can't.  And has it never occurred to anybody that the existence of the pyramids in conjunction with the worship of an elite group of human beings, while everybody else was wearing loincloths and sweating in the hot sun, might suggest a relationship between the two?  The fact is, the Egyptian civilization seems to have been the chief example of a vast chasm between the haves and the have-nots, and they managed to do it longer than anybody else.

In examining the work of Schwaller, we have one of the better examples of the subtle way the negative occult societies attack those who come to bring light, by association and co-opting.  The tactic is to find a means of subtly allying their message with that of the truly Positive so as to generate confusion in untrained minds which would tend on surface evidence to accept these actually contrary messages as similar, at least in intent.

The negative occultists who are promoting the new Control System borrow all their components from what is of truth, and proceed by the method of imitation.  They literally will ape the expression of positive teachings, and all the more carefully when they wish to be mistaken altogether for purveyors of truth, so as to subvert the messages.

Their usual strategy is to begin by adhering so closely to the truth as to be virtually indistinguishable to all but heightened, thinking awareness.  They install their ideas through the rhythmic lull of entrainment so as to catch the "congregation" totally off guard when they finally diverge slightly or greatly from the truth and so pull the listener along with them.  The voice of deception is, of course, all the more ingratiatingly imitative of "goodness" where it is addressing a listener who is truly desirous of seeking truth; those who are lazy to begin with don't need such careful wording to deceive them as they are already willing to be deceived.

And so it was that Mouravieff, under the influence of the Synarchists of his day, introduced some of their ideas into his own synthesis of the authentic Tradition, including the idea that the Tradition was passed from Egypt to Judaea via Moses.

What seems to be the Truth is that the Tradition came from the North, the fabled land of the Hyperboreans, via Orpheus and Pythagoras.

Accounts of the travels and studies of Pythagoras differ, but most historians agree that he visited many countries and studied at the feet of many masters. Supposedly, after having been initiated into the Eleusinian mysteries, he went to Egypt and was initiated into the Mysteries of Isis. He then traveled to Phoenicia and Syria and was initiated into the Mysteries of Adonis. After that, he traveled to the valley of the Euphrates and learned all the secrets of the Chaldeans still living in the area of Babylon. Finally, he traveled to Media and Persia, then to India where he was a pupil and initiate of the Brahmins there. Sounds like he had all the bases covered.

Pythagoras was said to have invented the term "philosopher" in preference to the word "sage" since the former meant one who is attempting to find the truth, and the latter means one who knows the truth. Apparently Pythagoras didn't think he had the whole banana.

Pythagoras started a school at Crotona in Southern Italy and gathered students and disciples there whom he supposedly instructed in the principles of the secrets that had been revealed to him. He considered mathematics, music and astronomy to be the foundation of all the arts and sciences. When he was about sixty years old, he married one of his disciples and had seven children. I guess he was a pretty lively senior citizen! His wife was, apparently, quite a woman in her own right and she carried on his work after he was assassinated by a band of murderers incited to violence by a student whom he refused to initiate. The accounts of Pythagoras' murder vary. Some say he and all his disciples were killed, others say that he may have escaped because some of his students protected him by sacrificing themselves and that he later died of a broken heart when he realized the apparent fruitlessness of his efforts to illuminate humanity.

The experts say that very little remains of the teachings of Pythagoras in the present time unless it has been handed down in secret schools or societies. And, naturally, every secret society on the planet claims to have this "initiated" knowledge to one extent or another. It is possible that there exists some of the original secret numerical formulas of Pythagoras, but the sad fact is that there is no real evidence of it in the writings that have issued from these groups for the past millennium. Though everyone discusses Pythagoras, no one seems to know any more than the post-Pythagorean Greek speculators who "talked much, wrote little, knew less, and concealed their ignorance under a series of mysterious hints and promises." There seems to be a lot of that going around these days! Even Plutarch did not pretend to be able to explain the significance of the geometrical diagrams of Pythagoras. However, he did make the most interesting suggestion that the relationship which Pythagoras established between the geometrical solids and the gods was the result of images seen in the Egyptian temples. And that, of course, could be misleading.

Albert Pike, the great Masonic symbolist, also admitted that there were many things that he couldn't figure out. In his Symbolism for the 32nd and 33rd degrees he wrote:

    I do not understand why the 7 should be called Minerva, or the cube, Neptune. ...Undoubtedly the names given by the Pythagoreans to the different numbers were themselves enigmatical and symbolic - and there is little doubt that in the time of Plutarch the meanings these names concealed were lost. Pythagoras had succeeded too well in concealing his symbols with a veil that was from the first impenetrable, without his oral explanation.

Manly Hall writes:

    This uncertainty shared by all true students of the subject proves conclusively that it is unwise to make definite statements founded on the indefinite and fragmentary information available concerning the Pythagorean system of mathematical philosophy.

With what little we have examined thus far, we are beginning to realize how true this latter remark is. Of course, in the present time, there is a whole raft of folks who don't let such remarks stop them. Any number of modern gurus claim to have discovered the secrets of "Sacred Geometry!" Not only that, they don't seem to have even studied the matter deeply at all, missing many of the salient points that are evident in the fragments of Pythagorean teachings. Regarding this, there is a passage in Foucault's Pendulum, by Umberto Eco, that explicates the problem:

    Amid all the nonsense there are some unimpeachable truths... I invite you to go and measure [an arbitrarily selected] kiosk. You will see that the length of the counter is one hundred and forty-nine centimeters - in other words, one hundred-billionth of the distance between the earth and the sun. The height at the rear, one hundred and seventy-six centimeters, divided by the width of the window, fifty-six centimeters, is 3.14. The height at the front is nineteen decimeters, equal, in other words, to the number of years of the Greek lunar cycle. The sum of the heights of the two front corners is one hundred and ninety times two plus one hundred and seventy-six times two, which equals seven hundred and thirty-two, the date of the victory at Poitiers. The thickness of the counter is 3.10 centimeters, and the width of the cornice of the window is 8.8 centimeters. Replacing the numbers before the decimals by the corresponding letters of the alphabet, we obtain C for ten and H for eight, or C10H8, which is the formula for naphthalene.

    ...With numbers you can do anything you like. Suppose I have the sacred number 9 and I want to get the number 1314, date of the execution of Jacques de Molay - a date dear to anyone who professes devotion to the Templar tradition of knighthood. ...Multiply nine by one hundred and forty-six, the fateful day of the destruction of Carthage. How did I arrive at this? I divided thirteen hundred and fourteen by two, by three, et cetera, until I found a satisfying date. I could also have divided thirteen hundred and fourteen by 6.28, the double of 3.14, and I would have got two hundred and nine. That is the year Attalus I, king of Pergamon, ascended the throne.

    You see? ...The universe is a great symphony of numerical correspondences... numbers and their symbolisms provide a path to special knowledge. But if the world, below and above, is a system of correspondences where tout se tient, it's natural for the [lottery] kiosk and the pyramid, both works of man, to reproduce in their structure, unconsciously, the harmonies of the cosmos. [Eco]

The idea has been promoted with great vigor for over a thousand years that so-called Kabbalists and "interpreters of mysteries" can discover with their incredibly tortuous methods The Truth, completely misses the point of a truth that is far more ancient: Mathematics is the language of Nature. The Pythagoreans declared arithmetic to be the mother of the mathematical sciences. This idea was based on the fact that geometry, music, and astronomy are dependent upon arithmetic, but arithmetic is not dependent upon them. In this sense, geometry may be removed but arithmetic will remain; but if arithmetic be removed, geometry will be eliminated. In the same way, music depends on arithmetic. Eliminating music affects arithmetic only by limiting one of its expressions.

Why do we think that Esoteric Christianity is related to the ancient Eleusinian mysteries?

The cult of Demeter which celebrated the Eleusinian rites was well established in Mycenaea in the 13th century BC, and it is more than likely that the Feast of Tabernacles in Canaan was an offshoot of this activity. Our sources of information regarding the Eleusinian Mysteries include the ruins of the sanctuary there; numerous statues, bas reliefs, and pottery. We also have reports from ancient writers such as Aeschylos, Sophocles, Herodotus, Aristophanes, Plutarch, and Pausanias - all of whom were initiates - as well as the accounts of Christian commentators like Clement of Alexandria, Hippolytus, Tertullian, and Astorias, who were critics and not initiates. Yet for all this evidence, the true nature of the Mysteries remains shrouded in uncertainty because the participants were remarkably steadfast in honoring their pledge not to reveal what took place in the Telesterion, or inner sanctum of the Temple of Demeter. To violate that oath of secrecy was a capital offense. For these reasons,scholars today must make use of circumstantial evidence and inferences, with the result that there is still no consensus as to what did or did not take place.

Many experts have concluded - probably erroneously - that the Mysteries at Eleusis originally must have come from Egypt. The fact is, the sanctuary ruins in Eleusis evidently go back centuries earlier than the Egyptian Hymn to Demeter recited by Homer that is often cited as the proof that the origin was Egyptian. What is more, the excavations have unearthed no Egyptian artifacts there from that period.

Many scholars today favor the view that the cult of Demeter probably derived from Thessaly or Thrace. They base this conclusion partly on references in Homer and other ancient authors to some evidently pre-Dorian temples to Demeter in the Thessalian towns of Thermopylae, Pyrasos, and Pherai; partly on certain etymological links connecting key words in the rites of Demeter to pre-Hellenic dialects from the north . Other scholars point out that Demeter may be the same as a goddess "Dameter," who is mentioned briefly in Linear B tablets from Pylos dating from approximately 1200 BC. This evidence suggests that the cult of Demeter may after all have originated in the southern Peleponnesus.

In any case, whether the specific cult of Demeter at Eleusis originated in northern or southern Greece, the undeniable parallels with worship of grain goddesses in other parts of the eastern Mediterranean region point to frequent contacts and the cross-fertilization of religious ideas. And we certainly think that the Canaanite Feast of Tabernacles was a corrupted version of some more ancient form.

As it happens, the term "Thesmophoria" is derived from thesmoi, meaning "laws," and phoria, "carrying," in reference to the goddess as "law-bearer." But the symbolism of the ark as the "law bearer" in the "tent of meeting," or the "Mother-Delta," the "doorway to the higher realms," replaced the original meaning and the role of women in the process. Based on our own researches, we believe that True Christianity - which is almost virtually unknown today - was a resurgence of a very ancient Tradition - and that this same Tradition was preserved, in part, in Shamanic lore, was part of the Cathar beliefs as well as the true meaning of the Grail legends.

Jessie L. Weston writes in From Ritual to Romance:

    The more closely one studies pre-Christian Theology, the more strongly one is impressed with the deeply and daringly spiritual character of its speculations, and the more doubtful it appears that such teaching can depend upon the unaided processes of human thought, or can have been evolved from such germs as we find among the supposedly 'primitive' peoples... Are they really primitive? Or are we dealing, not with the primary elements of religion, but with the disjecta membra of a vanished civilization?

    Certain it is that so far as historical evidence goes our earliest records point to the recognition of a spiritual, not of a material, origin of the human race. Students of the Grail literature cannot fail to have been impressed by a certain atmosphere of awe and mystery which surrounds that enigmatic Vessel. There is a secret connected with it, the revelation of which will entail dire misfortune on the betrayer. [...] It is so secret a thing that no woman, be she wife or maid, may venture to speak of it. [...]

    There is no doubt that the Grail was something secret, mysterious and awful, the exact knowledge of which was reserved to a select few. […] The Nature Cults still remain reliable guides; it is their inner, their esoteric, ritual which will enable us to bridge the gulf between what appears at first sight the wholly irreconcilable elements of Folk-tale and high Spiritual mystery."

In our work on Noah, we have tracked the Grail legends back to prehistoric times - in Western Europe and Central Asia - via the very area emphasized in many other ancient myths, including that of Jason and the Argonauts: Colchis and the Caucasus regions. Mircea Eliade writes:

    Recent researches have clearly brought out the "shamanic" elements in the religion of the paleolithic hunters. Horst Kierchner has interpreted the celebrated relief at Lascaux as a representation of a shamanic trance. The same author considers that the "kommandostabe" - mysterious objects found in prehistoric sites - are drumsticks. If this interpretation is accepted, the prehistoric sorcerers would already have used drums comparable to those of the Siberian shamans.

    Finally, Karl J. Narr has reconsidered the problem of the "origin" and chronology of shamanism in his important study. He brings out the influence of notions of fertility (Venus statuettes) on the religious beliefs of the prehistoric North Asian hunters; but this influence did not disrupt the paleolithic tradition. His conclusions are as follows: Animal skulls and bones found in the sites of the European Paleolithic (before 50,000 - ca. 30,000 BC) can be interpreted as ritual offerings. [...] Soon afterward, probably about 25,000 BC, Europe offers evidence for the earliest forms of shamanism (Lascaux) with the plastic representations of the bird, the tutelary spirit, and ecstasy. [...]

    What appears to be certain is the antiquity of "shamanic" rituals and symbols. It remains to be determined whether these documents brought to light by prehistoric discoveries represent the first expressions of a shamanism in statu nascendi or are merely the earliest documents today available for an earlier religious complex, which, however, did not find "plastic" manifestations (drawings, ritual objects, etc) before the period of Lascaux.[…]

    Everywhere in those lands, [ in Central and North Asia,] and from the earliest times, we find documents for the existence of a Supreme Being of celestial structure, who also corresponds morphologically to all the other Supreme Beings of the archaic religions. The symbolism of ascent, with all the rites and myths dependent on it, must be connected with celestial Supreme Beings; we know that "height" was sacred as such, that many supreme gods of archaic peoples are called "He on high," or "he of the Sky," or simply "Sky." This symbolism of ascent and "height" retains its value even after the "withdrawal" of the celestial Supreme Being - for, as is well known, Supreme Beings gradually lose their active place in the cult, giving way to religious forms that are more "dynamic" and "familiar" (the gods of storm and fertility, demiurges, the souls of the dead, the Great Goddesses, etc.) […]

    The reduction or even the total loss in religious currency of uranian Supreme Beings is sometimes indicated in myths concerning a primordial and paradisal time when communications between heaven and earth were easy and accessible to everyone; as the result of some happening, these communications were broken off and the Supreme Beings withdrew to the highest sky.[…    insert Saturn theory how it withdrew

The disappearance of the cult of the celestial Supreme Being did not nullify the symbolism of ascent with all its implication. […] The shamanic ecstasy could be considered a reactualization of the mythical illud tempus when men could communicate in concreto with the sky. It is indubitable that the celestial ascent of the shaman is a survival, profoundly modified and sometimes degenerate, of this archaic religious ideology centered on faith in a celestial Supreme Being and belief in concrete communications between heaven and earth. […] The myths refer to more intimate relations between the Supreme Beings and shamans; in particular, they tell of a First Shaman, sent to earth by the Supreme Being or his surrogate to defend human beings against diseases and evil spirits.

    This historical change in the religions of Central and North Asia […] in turn altered the meaning of the shaman's ecstatic experience. Descents to the underworld, the struggle against evil spirits, the increasingly familiar relations with "spirits" that result in their "embodiment" or in the shaman's being "possessed" by "spirits," are innovations, most of them recent. In addition, there are the influences from the south, which appeared quite early and which altered both cosmology and the mythology and techniques of ecstasy. Among these southern influences we must reckon, in later times, the contribution of Buddhism and Lamaism, added to the Iranian and, in the last analysis, Mesopotamian influences that preceded them.

    The initiatory schema of the shaman's ritual death and resurrection is likewise an innovation, but one that goes back to much earlier times; in any case, it cannot be ascribed to influences from the ancient Near East. But the innovations introduced by the ancestor cult particularly affected the structure of this initatory schema. The very concept of mystical death was altered by the many and various religious changes effected by lunar mythologies, the cult of the dead, and the elaboration of magical ideologies.[including Egyptian]

    Hence we must conceive of Asiatic shamanism as an archaic technique of ecstasy whose original underlying ideology - belief in a celestial Supreme Being with whom it was possible to have direct relations by ascending into the sky - was constantly being transformed by a ongoing series of exotic contributions culminating in the invasion of Buddhism.

    The concept of mystical death, furthermore, encouraged increasingly regular relations with the ancestral souls and the "spirits," relations that ended in "possession." The phenomenology of the trance underwent many changes and corruptions, due in large part to confusion as to the precise nature of ecstasy. Yet all these innovations and corruptions did not succeed in eliminating the possibility of the true shamanic ecstasy.

    More than once we have discerned in the shamanic experience a "nostalgia for paradise" that suggests one of the oldest types of Christian mystical experience. As for the "inner light," which plays a part of the first importance in Indian mysticism and metaphysics as well as in Christian mystical theology, it is already documented in shamanism.

    But shamanism is important not only for the place that it holds in the history of mysticism. The shamans have played an essential role in the defense of the psychic integrity of the community They are preeminently the antidemonic champions; they combat not only demons and disease, but also the black magicians. [A shaman is a] tireless slayer of demons. The military elements that are of great importance in certain types of Asian shamanism (lance, cuirass, bow, sword, etc.) are accounted for by the requirements of war against the demons, the true enemies of humanity. In a way it can be said that shamanism defends life, health, fertility, the world of "light," against death, diseases, sterility, disaster, and the world of "darkness."[...]

    What is fundamental and universal is the shaman's struggle against what we could call "the powers of evil." […] The shaman's essential role in the defense of the psychic integrity of the community depends above all on this: men are sure that one of them is able to help them in the critical circumstances produced by the inhabitants of the invisible world. […] A member of the community is able to see what is hidden and invisible to the rest and to bring back direct and reliable information from the supernatural worlds.[…]

    We have already referred to the likenesses between the accounts of shamanic ecstasies and certain epic themes in oral literature. The shaman's adventures in the other world, the ordeals that he undergoes in his ecstatic descents below and ascents to the sky, suggest the adventures of the figures in popular tales and the heroes of epic literature. Probably a large number of epic "subjects" or motifs, as well as many characters, images, and cliches of epic literature, are, finally, of ecstatic origin, in the sense that they were borrowed from the narrative of shamans describing their journeys and adventures in the superhuman worlds. [ Eliade, Mircea, Shamanism, Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy.]

In short, we suggest that Esoteric Christianity - the REAL teachings of Jesus - were a revival of the most ancient of True Traditions of Freedom - an antediluvian tradition handed down from the Ancient Athenians of Plato's myth - the defenders of the world against the Evil Empire of Atlantis. This Evil Empire of Atlantis is reincarnated in the present day - the controlling empire of our world - and seeks to establish a One World control system exactly as Atlantis did ages ago. Part of the means of doing this includes brainwashing the masses, even those who are seeking alternative explanations in philosophy and religion. For those who seek outside the already corrupted standard religions, there is now the Stargate Conspiracy - the promotion of Egyptian and South American mysticism as the source of the Tradition. And it is a lie.

Christianity is quite interesting when one removes the obvious gloss of the Egyptian resurrection myth. When the reader is fully informed about the variations on these two themes, it is almost pathetically easy to read the New Testament and see what might be original to "Jesus," and what was added by the "creators" of Christianity as we know it.

What is even more interesting was the fact that the only writings contemporary to the times of early Christianity, which mention it specifically, remark that it is a "vile superstition." Yet, what we have as Christianity today, is nothing more or less than the same religious practices of the peoples who branded it a "vile superstition." Obviously something very strange happened between the times of the early Christians, and the times in which Christianity became the established religion. And whatever it was that happened, changed Christianity from a "vile superstition" to an acceptable, all-inclusive, monotheistic device. In short, it seems evident that "true Christianity" has completely disappeared from the world stage and those individuals who call themselves Christian are not, in fact, Christians in the original sense of the word by any stretch of the imagination.

The question that comes to mind is: what would the peoples of that time have considered a "vile superstition," when one is aware of what they considered normal religious practice? The only thing that seemed to fit the bill, so to say, is the possibility that whoever was the figure around which the Jesus legend was wrapped, was teaching that the "God of this world" was an "evil magician." Not only that, but that he probably suggested that man is the manifestation of God, and all creation is the "body of God," and that there was no point in praying to an "external god" at all. Now that would have set just about everybody back then on fire! To suggest that sacrifice to the gods, that appeasing the gods, that honoring the gods, that praying to the gods, that expecting to be saved by or cleansed from sin by any of the gods, was a waste of time would have been absolute heresy to all of the many religions! For them, such an idea, and only such an idea, would have been most definitely a "vile superstition."

In fact, we have something of a parallel in some remarks about Pythagoras. He was accused of believing the "vile superstitions" of the barbarians, that a soul is born over and over again into different bodies as opposed to the nonsense of the Egyptians that induced them to place all their hopes in a physical resurrection, for which purpose they went to such extremes as attempting to preserve their bodies for that future resurrection!

Clement of Alexandria writes:

    These are the times of the oldest wise men and philosophers among the Greeks. And that the most of them were barbarians by extraction, and were trained among barbarians, what need is there to say? Pythagoras is shown to have been either a Tuscan or a Tyrian. And Antisthenes was a Phrygian. And Orpheus was an Odrysian or a Thracian. The most, too, show Homer to have been an Egyptian. Thales was a Phoenician by birth, and was said to have consorted with the prophets of the Egyptians; as also Pythagoras did with the same persons, by whom he was circumcised, that he might enter the adytum and learn from the Egyptians the mystic philosophy. He held converse with the chief of the Chaldeans and the Magi; and he gave a hint of the church, now so called, in the common hall which he maintained. And Plato does not deny that he procured all that is most excellent in philosophy from the barbarians; and he admits that he came into Egypt.

    Whence, writing in the Phaedo that the philosopher can receive aid from all sides, he said: "Great indeed is Greece, O Cebes, in which everywhere there are good men, and many are the races of the barbarians."[…]

    And in the Symposium, Plato, landing the barbarians as practicing philosophy with conspicuous excellence, truly says: "And in many other instances both among Greeks and barbarians, whose temples reared for such sons are already numerous." And it is clear that the barbarians signally honoured their lawgivers and teachers, designating them gods. For, according to Plato, "they think that good souls, on quitting the supercelestial region, submit to come to this Tartarus; and assuming a body, share in all the ills which are involved in birth, from their solicitude for the race of men;" and these make laws and publish philosophy, "than which no greater boon ever came from the gods to the race of men, or will come.[…]

    And it is well known that Plato is found perpetually celebrating the barbarians, remembering that both himself and Pythagoras learned the most and the noblest of their dogmas among the barbarians.[…] [Circa AD 260-340]

But, as one notices when reading Clement, he has an agenda to validate Judaism and the New Covenant of Christianity. He identified "barbarians" as including Egyptians, Persian, Hindus, Babylonians, Phrygians, and so on. Again we find that all we can discover about the deeper beliefs of the ancient secret schools is what we hear from their detractors. In the end, Clement promoted the idea that the "true philosophy" was Hebrew, and that it was preserved most closely in the Egyptian "Mystery Schools." This twisting of the facts by someone with an agenda, has been the foundation for centuries of researchers to look in the wrong direction for the answers, and to follow the wrong clues regarding such things as the Ark of the Covenant and the Holy Grail.

The teaching of Jesus - whatever his real name was - was obviously this True Tradition, and was later corrupted and glossed by those who rewrote the Bible for purposes of power and control.

    But this is nothing new.  Time after time the Esoteric Tradition is misunderstood or deliberately buried, and so it dies.  Then, when the time is ripe, it must either be restored or rephrased.  In the meantime, the meaning is kept alive in communities or schools symbolized by the name "ark," of which Noah's Ark was one.

    A clear sign that the inner knowledge has been misunderstood is the idea that the inner knowledge is "secret."  This misunderstanding comes from a lack of comprehension of the term "inner" itself.  The impression is conveyed that these ideas are the possession of an "inner group" and are not to be given to others, when nothing could be further from the truth.  The real problem is due to what we now understand as "vectors of direction," the many "agents of the Matrix" in our reality who interpret the terminology in a purely material way, and promote their versions on the unsuspecting public.  An example is the case of the crucifixion itself.  The words that Paul used to describe "Christ crucified" have nothing to do with an historical event, and everything to do with an "inner event."  The crucifixion describes things which can and do happen within and between serious esoteric students and is a clear analogy for problems of the inner life of man which urgently require study.  Those who understand the crucifixion in a purely outward way, or who cling to the past as promoted by the Control System, miss the living tradition.

    As Jesus said:  "let the dead bury the dead."

    The fact is: inner knowledge is freely available to all those who are willing to look into themselves and face the pain that this brings.

Boris Mouravieff tells us that the Christian Esoteric Tradition has always remained alive within certain monasteries in Greece, Russia, and elsewhere.  It is true that this knowledge was hermetically hidden, but at the same time, its existence was known and access to it was never forbidden to those seriously interested in esoteric questions.

Mouravieff tells us that his commentaries are drawn directly from the Eastern Christian Tradition: the sacred texts, the commentaries written around these texts, and especially from the Philokalia which is, above all, the same teaching and discipline, transmitted by fully authorized individuals.

Attentive examination and comparison of Mouravieff's work to that of Ouspensky and Gurdjieff will show the incomplete character of the latter, as well as the deviations from the ancient doctrine.

    Christ categorically affirmed that entry into the Kingdom of God is closed to those who have not been born anew.  This second Birth is the object and goal of esoteric work.

Mouravieff tells us:

    The greatest genuine faith, human intelligence, and goodwill, are not sufficient to prevent errors and deviations in everything that touches the domain of Revelation.  The errors and deviations of Ouspensky's book [declared by Gurdjieff to have been accurate as far as it went] - attest to the fact that it was not written under the aegis of the Esoteric Brotherhood.  This means that the facts on which the book was based have a fragmentary character,  In the esoteric realm, all fragmentary knowledge is a source of danger.

As it was in the past, so it is in the present:  certain Gnostic schools, seeing the imperfection of the created world, and without searching for the reason for the existence of these imperfections, have, by a shortcut of thought, jumped to conclusions. One modern day example is the work of Dr. J.S. Chiappalone.

    The Tradition is One, whether it is the esoteric core of Hinduism, Buddhism, Sufism, or Sufism, and whoever delves deeply into these things cannot fail to note the Unity of the teachings.  All the great religions which have issued from the One Tradition are messages of truth - yet each of them addresses only part of humanity - parts with certain character.  Esoteric Christianity , in its perfect expression, aims at a general resurrection while other doctrines, even though they belong to the Truth, essentially aim at individual salvation and are therefore only partial revelations of the Tradition.

    Most of the writings of the Philokalia were intended for people who had already acquired some proficiency in esoteric studies.  One could actually say the same about the Gospels, corrupted and glossed though they be.  Bishop Theophan, in his preface to the Philokalia, insists on the fact that without help nobody can succeed in penetrating the doctrine.  This is why esoteric science conserves and cultivates an oral tradition which brings the letter to life.  Oriental Orthodoxy has known how to keep this Tradition intact by applying the absolute rule of Hermetism in each particular case.  From generation to generation, ever since the time of the Apostles, it has led its disciples up to mystic experience.

    If Hermetism has provided a safeguard for nearly twenty centuries, it must be said that circumstances have now changed.  At the current point in history, as at the time of the Coming of Christ, the veil has been partially raised.  Therefore, for those who want to advance beyond book knowledge, which never goes beyond the domain of information; for those who intensely seek the true sense of life, who want to understand the significance of the mission of those who labor in the vineyards of the Lord at the time of the Harvest, the possibility exists for initiation into this divine Wisdom, mysterious and hidden.

Mouravieff tells us that clarity of the New Testament can be extracted from obscurity by comparison to the Slavonic texts.  There are two reasons for this.  The first is that the translation of the New Testament into Slavonic was done at a time when the spirit of the texts still remained close to the original meaning.  The second is that the fixed nature of the Slavonic languages, Russian in particular, remain very close to the old Slavonic language which is still in used in the divine service of the Orthodox religion in the Slavic countries.

    The Slavonic text is generally attributed to Constantine the Philosopher, also known as St. Cyril, and to his brother St. Methodius, both learned Greeks from Salonika.  Arriving in Chersonese of Tauric, St. Cyril found, in the ninth century, that the Gospels were already written in this language, suggesting that they were produced in a period when the forms remained alive - as stated by the apostle St. Andrew, who taught Christianity in Russia in the first century of the present era… close to the time of the events.

Mouravieff notes that all serious esoteric teaching, as in ordinary education, is almost uniform.

    It is generally accepted that nobody can go on to secondary school without having completed an elementary education.  Nor can a person be admitted to a university without having a secondary education.  These graduations automatically "select" those able to become active members of the cultural elite of human society.

    Exactly the same is true in the esoteric Tradition.

    However, in our modern world, we encounter a curious phenomenon.  For example: we would not seek to discuss Newton's binomial theorem without having studied algebra, for without this, every opinion we expressed on the subject would be worthless.

Yet, in the esoteric field, we find a host of "experts" who declare their opinions on esotericism without having ever learned even the rudiments of this knowledge.

    At the same time, some of them demand "simplicity" from esoteric teachings on the generally accepted principle that Truth itself must be simple.  They conclude from this that access to Truth ought to likewise be simple.  Then they assert that the methods to access Truth must be easily assimilable.

    This argument would be perfectly correct if human beings and the problems they face were simple and just.  However, that is not the case.  There is a long road to travel from our state of distorted inner disorder to any "original simplicity."

    In practice, the doctrine of "simplicity" - if regarded as an axiom - turns the student aside from the strait gate and the narrow way that leads to Life.  Impelled by this counter-truth, he believes he stands before this door, when he is in reality - although undoubtedly in perfectly good faith - walking the wide path that leads to perdition, ad majorem Diaboli gloriam, of course.

    The Doctrine of Simplicity, correct in itself, but wrongly interpreted, becomes a snare for hearts and minds that are already too corrupt; a danger which should be recognized and avoided.

    Some people complain that the subject of the fundamentals of esotericism is not simple.  Others have said that it leads to great clarity.  This apparent contradiction is explained by the fact that esotericism is addressed to readers who are predisposed to esoteric culture by their nature, formation or personal experience.

        Jesus said: "Beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves."  And then he adds:  "You shall know them by their fruits."

    It is difficult, if not impossible, for an esoterically unevolved person to discern false prophets spontaneously.  He will recognize them more easily by their "fruits," by the observable results of their works, which serve as signs.  The Tradition knows and teaches a whole Science of signs.

        Jesus further said:  "Temptations (snares, traps set to entice to sin) are sure to come, but woe to him by or through whom they come!  It would be more profitable for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were hurled into the sea than that he should cause to sin or be a snare…"

    This warning is disturbing, but its value is real.  A thief can carry off our wealth; a 'ravening wolf' can deprive us of salvation. 

    That 'ravening wolves' appear in sheep's clothing we shall learn from the following text, well-phrased to frighten us:

        "It is not everyone that saith unto me:  Lord, Lord, who shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that accomplishes the will of my Father which is in Heaven.  Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name?  And in thy name have cast out devils?  And in thy name done many wonderful works?  And then I shall declare unto them, I never knew you: depart from Me, ye who work iniquity."

    The conclusion is that neither prophecies that are fulfilled nor the occurrence of miracles give us any surety against 'ravening wolves.'

        And in our own times: "There shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they should deceive the very elect."

    Our era is the time of Transition.  We are in the heart of this period, which is relatively short.  All the signs show that the necessary conditions for the End are emerging before our very eyes.

    This time brings with it a great preparatory task for the transition to the approaching Cycle of the Holy Spirit.  The preparatory task fundamental to the Time of Transition can and must be accomplished under the Aegis of the Absolute, for human beings and BY human beings.  Success depends upon the emergence in the near future of a sufficient number of people belonging to a new human type - torch bearers who have an innate predisposition for esoteric work.  And, it is Women who must play the inspirational role in this difficult time of Transition leading to the promised era of redemption.

    The objective of esoteric work is the march towards Consciousness, which means towards Truth.  The final aim that man can hope to achieve by esoteric work is to attain the Second Birth and so overcome Death. 

    With rare exceptions, this aim can only be attained by the student through hared and methodical work.  The sum of the conscious efforts required is proportional to the degeneracy of the Personality.

    The discipline is accepted voluntarily, but it is of iron.  The student can abandon the work at any moment to return to worldly interests.

    The freedom of choice and the initiative demanded of the seeker bring a danger: that of taking the false for the true; the impure for the pure, allowing himself to become subject to traps and snares.  When such errors are made by the pure in heart, they will be warned in time, even if they persist in their error. 

    The real danger, which can lead to mortal sin, to a definite check, occurs when an impure heart seeks to be served by higher psychic forces for its own egoistic ends.  This is a quagmire.

    A curious phenomenon often occurs in the human mind when it considers the generally hermetized theories and facts of the esoteric realm.

    In any field of science, pure, moral, applied, it is generally accepted that we must be well versed in a subject before we can give a valid opinion.  To speak seriously, one must speak of what one knows, which presupposes previous studies.

    In the esoteric domain, many purveyors of "esoteric science" believe themselves to be competent without even completing an elementary education.  They may receive all kinds of "insights" and messages from all kinds of sources, but the problem with that is that they judge these messages and teachings to be positive or true before they have even developed within themselves the correct instrument with which to judge.

    The problem is:  we KNOW that any given thing can only be conceived, understood and judged by something similar or higher.  Without this, all judgments, discussions and advice about esoteric facts remain comparable to evaluations and opinions about the shade of a specific color by someone born blind.

    Just as the world we live in is closed off, invisible to the fetus in its mother's womb until the awakening of its birth, even so the higher planes of Life, the astral and spiritual, are similarly closed and invisible to us until the Second Birth.  Until then, man can only form hypotheses or refer to the testimony of authors who have themselves been Twice born.

    As for passing valid judgments of these facts, no one can do this until he has himself crossed the second Threshold. 

    What seems clear is that it is commonplace these days for people of perfectly good faith to persist in their ignorant attitudes about esotericism.  This phenomenon is due to two principle causes.  One is the general tendency of humans to claim qualities which exist in them only in potential, and the second - a consequence of the first - is the deification of Personality.  Without doing any real, prolonged work, they "trust themselves" or rely on their own "truth" to guide them. 

    We are not speaking here of people of bad faith; we are speaking of sincere people who stray into gross error.  Their case is precisely that of the sick in need of a physician.  They are small "Sauls" who could be converted to small "Pauls," and thus might become useful laborers and earn a reward in the fields of the Lord.  But they wander in their searching beyond the place where they could receive compensation for the work that they have done.

    In esoteric work the phenomenalist mentality seeks facts.  It looks for manifestations that confirm that its work is well founded, or which simply satisfy its curiosity.  This is where the snares and traps and greatest dangers lie.  For it is often possible to obtain the desired "facts" quite easily from the astral realms, to which the human personality also belongs.  When the personality is firmly anchored in the physical body it is generally incapable of making direct connection with the astral levels.  However, certain persons, known as sensitives, have the innate or acquired faculty of momentarily weakening the ties of the personality to the physical body so that, with no esoteric evolution whatever, they are able to connect with this level - connecting to the coarsest levels of the astral.

    "Facts" obtained this way are often regarded by people who seek them as coming from the spiritual level.  However, this level is a vast reservoir of psychic entities that have no contact with the higher plane, including amongst them discarnate Personalities, who normally remain there to await their Second Death - the negative equivalent of the Second Birth.  This usually occurs on the fortieth day after death of the physical body.

    The Tradition expressly warns seekers against contacts with this realm which is so dangerous and full of the worst illusions. 

    The power of intervention of these entities in the lives of humans is a function of the credulity they meet.  The yearning to experience miracles, visions, etc, creates an atmosphere favorable for their appearance, which can assume various forms, often perceptible to the physical senses.

    In the materialist mind of the cultured man of our era, the true and the false in esoteric research easily become mixed together.  This entanglement shows above all in the domain of our affections, which are generally unbalanced in us because the habit of lying has become our true second nature.  The innate faculty of immediate discernment of the true from the false is thus lost, and man, even the most cultured and learned, becomes singularly credulous, particularly in the mystical realm.

    This imbalance affects us according to law:  credulity is inversely proportional to true faith. 

And here we must define faith: 

    Faith is an openness and trusting attitude to truth and reality, whatever it may turn out to be.  This is a risky and adventurous state of mind.  Belief, in the religious sense, is the opposite of faith – because it is a fervent wishing or hope, a compulsive clinging to the idea that the universe is arranged and governed in such and such a way.  Belief is holding to a rock; faith is learning how to swim – and this whole universe swims in boundless space.[1]

In other words, the less open we are to truth and reality, the more our credulity grows and the more we are inclined to adopt "beliefs" and rituals, often taking grotesque forms. In this mechanism we can see the familiar action of the General Law of Accident which is the essence of the Matrix: 

    To inspire the man who seeks the Way with the idea that he is already on the way.  This is the best and the most common means used by the "Devil" to turn away the seeker who has had insufficient warning from the narrow way which leads to Life.  Jesus asked:

        How can ye believe which receive glory from one another, and seek not the glory that comes from God only?

    When we accept the "glory of men," yet still believe that we are on or walking on the Way, we fall directly under the law of equilibrium.  Jesus alluded to this when he quoted the Pharisees who prayed in the streets, saying that "they have already received their reward."

    It is well understood that the human Personality, in the unfinished state in which we find it, forms our only instrument for esoteric work.  Better still, it is a gift; it is the talent the Master has given us so that we may make it bear fruit.  Woe to the servant who buries it in the earth of his body.  "Cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth."  And here, this is no metaphor. 

    We must therefore work with love and with all our strength since we do not know at what hour the Master will come.

     This being so, the attitude of the esoteric Doctrine towards lying is clear  and realistic.  ...We must fight energetically against .. useless lies.

    It is only by training of this nature that we shall progressively be able to  master the rooted tendency to lie which exists within us.  Every attempt to  hurry things, so far as lying to others is concerned, though it be a noble  attempt, is doomed to early failure.  We live in a world which is immersed in  lies and moved by lies.

    It is also necessary to guard against a variant of the habit of lying to  ourselves, one which we commonly adopt from early childhood, and against which  we must fight by every means.  This variant is widespread because at first  glance it appears to us to be a positive attitude.  ...When applied to  ourselves and for our own benefit, with the aim of softening a shock, or  regaining our inner peace after we have sinned, or excusing our actions or  faults, this idiom crystallizes within us over a period of time an auto- tranquilizing mechanism.  ...It is a true mechanism of mental anesthesia,  founded on a refined and disguised lie.  It sows hypocrisy in man towards  himself.

    This auto-tranquillizer must be destroyed."

But we see so often how desperately people want to be "tranquilize."  How  many individuals have written to us asking for an answer that would help  them feel peaceful and enable them to go to sleep at night.  They want  "positive messages."  They want a program of meditation that will make them  feel good, or something to do or "look forward to" that will ease their anxiety  when they glimpse, momentarily, the reality of the Matrix.  They want to feel  chosen and special by virtue of having been "contacted" and performing rituals without doing the absolutely agonizing work necessary to precipitate transformation.

Mouravieff continues:

    The permanent link which must be introduced between the Personality and the  real "I" is esoteric Knowledge.  The knowledge and understanding that it  permits us to acquire represent the philosopher's stone of the medieval  mystics.  They are capable of provoking in man the transmutation to which he  aspires.

    We must work ceaselessly, for fear of not succeeding in time.  One must work,  says Jesus,  "while it is day: the night comes when no man can work."

These commentaries of Mouravieff are absolutely invaluable, and would be helpful to every seeker on the path and reader of the Cassiopaean Material.  This is especially so because Mouravieff actually describes  things that  we have already experienced, even though we did not precisely  understand what it was we were doing, how or even why.

For example,  Mouravieff calls the influences of the material world, the Matrix, the  predator's mind, etc, the "A influences."  (He has diagrams showing how they  affect the consciousness.)  The influences of the esoteric center, the "real  world" concealed by the "matrix illusion," the "truth," are called "B  influences." 

He writes:

    If a man spends his life without distinguishing between "A" and "B"  influences, he will end as he started, one could say mechanically, driven by  the Law of Accident.  ...He can have a brilliant career in the meaning the  world gives to this expression.  Yet he will come to the end of his days  without having either learned or understood anything of the Reality.  And dust  returns to dust.

    In life, every being is subjected to a sort of competitive test.  If he  discerns the existence of the "B" influences; if he acquires a taste for  gathering and absorbing them; if he continually aspires to assimilate them  better; his mixed inner nature will slowly undergo a certain kind of evolution.

    And if the efforts which he makes to absorb the "B" influences are constant  and sufficient in force, a magnetic centre can be formed within him. 

    If this center once born in him is carefully developed, it takes form, and in  its turn will exercise an influence over the results of the "A" influences  which are always active, deflecting them.

    Such deflection may be violent.  In general it transgresses the laws of  exterior life and provokes many conflicts in and around man.  If he loses the  battle, he emerges with the conviction the the "B" influences are nothing but  illusion: that the only reality is represented by the "A" influences.  Slowly,  the magnetic center which had been formed within him is reabsorbed and  vanishes.  Then, from the esoteric point of view, his situation is worse than  the one he had started with, when he was just beginning to discern "B"  influences.

    But, if he emerges a winner in this FIRST struggle, his magnetic centre,  consolidated and reinforced, will draw him to a man having a "C" influence  stronger than his own, and possessing a stronger magnetic center.  And so on in  succession, the last man being in connection with another having in influence  "D", who will be his link with the Esoteric Center "E."

    Henceforth in life, that man will no longer be isolated. 

    To the measure of its growth, the man will escape the dominion of the law of  accident and enter the domain of consciousness.

Mouravieff then shows a diagram of the person who deludes himself and does not  struggle against the lies of the Matrix... who has not engaged in the work of  stripping away lies:

    This second figure, with black magnetic centers, represents the situation  where man deludes himself and, believing he is absorbing "B" influences and  making the necessary selection all the while, he in fact absorbs "A"  influences... This will put him into contact with people who possess magnetic  centers of the same nature: who are themselves duped or who dupe others, and  who have no direct or indirect link with the esoteric Center.

In both the Wave Series and the Adventure Series, we have been dealing with identifying these very influences and emphasizing the necessity of "collecting" the "A" influences in terms of "seeing the unseen" of what we have called the Theological Reality. We have also met many characters that are aptly described by Mouravieff in his diagram of those individuals who have deluded themselves and have created a magnetic center of negativity, and how they attract to themselves others with similar negative magnetic centers.

In other words, the activities described in the Adventures series - the constant questioning,  stripping, looking at what is difficult and dealing with it - the shocks of  seeing the Matrix, the "man behind the curtain," the effort to "see the unseen"  is the very activity of collecting these "B" influences which then lead to the  "magnetic center," or "lodestar," as the C's called it.

    Q: When I post material on the website, those people who resonate to the material believe that this refers to them also. I have been of the opinion that Unified Thought Form being must mean a very large group as represented in this density. I know that we are dealing with limiting terms. But, is this applied to people who CHOOSE the Cassiopaean option?
    A: Maybe it is best to say it applies to those who recognize the application.
    Q: So, if they recognize it, if they know it is them, they are part of it. (A) But, thinking in nonlinear terms, its up to us to work to make this precise. You are asking this question which implies that the answer exists. But, exactly what the answer is may be it is not yet chosen, and it is up to us to make it this way.
    A: Lodestar is a clue for you.

Mouravieff writes:

    This evolution seems a long process, an uninterrupted combat with a series of  successes and falls.  More than once, he who searches will fall into crises of  discouragement; more than once it will seem to him that he is being driven  beyond the limits of his own life; he will sometimes feel crushed under the  burden of the tests and difficulties against which he will be pitted during his  search. 

    This can be understood when we know that esoteric science in its teaching goes  far beyond simple information.  Its purpose, in fact, is nothing less than the  TRANSFORMATION of the very being of those who study it...

    In every case where esoteric science offers ALL, it demands ALL in return.  One  must pay all.

    It is impossible to reach the true by the path of lies or hypocritical games,  because in this case we seek to BE, rather than to "appear to be."

Mouravieff describes the reaction of the "matrix/ B influences" to the person  who is on the Path:

    As long as man accepts the principle of the final annihilation of his  Personality without a fight, he can carry on in life without attracting the  increasing pressure of the General Law of Accident upon himself.

    The case is totally different if he struggles to surpass the limits which it  imposes.  He then runs against the action upon him of this Law and its  derivatives.  It acts simultaneously on several planes: physical, mental and  moral.  Its action on the moral plane is conceived by man, since time  immemorial, in the form of the personification: the Devil."

We are also reminded of Gurdjieff's remarks about the "mechanical force"  having promoters and adherents at very high levels who act under its powerful  influences.  We suggest that both are 4 and 5 D STS beings.

    ...Once the first positive results are obtained those students will  unmistakable run up against the active opposition of the law and the "game of  the Crafty One."

    It must be realized that in placing himself under the aegis of the Law of  Exception, man goes against the General Law of Accident, which he is even   called upon to overthrow, if only on the individual scale.  He must no forget -  under penalty of "surprise attack" - that salvation depends on victory over the  Devil, which, as we have said, is the personalized moral aspect of the General  Law of Accident.  This is so even though this, being a cosmic law, is naturally  a divine law. 

    One must not be afraid, as the Law of Exception is also a divine law.

    In choosing it, man continues to serve the interest of the whole, but  differently and in an incomparably more efficient manner.

    During his fight against the first law, he is subject to tests that often take  the form of temptations.  ...We are permitted to draw attention to the indirect  nature of diabolical action.

    If, aiming straight towards his goal, which is liberation and salvation, the  seeker successfully overcomes the obstacles and by this shows proof of a  strength that would permit him to defy the authority of the General Law, the  latter will begin to act upon him indirectly, generally by the mediation of his  near ones if they do not follow the same path:  this action occurs on the moral  plane, and often takes emotional forms appealing to his most noble, generous  and disinterested sentiments: to his charity; his obligation; his pity.  It  impels him down blind alleys, insinuating that he will thus be returning to his  duty, that by so doing he will go on walking in the right path, etc. 

    This will clarify the profound saying of Jesus that : "A man's worst enemies  are those of his own household."

    Let us repeat:  esoteric work is by its nature a revolutionary work.  The  seeker seeks a change of state: to overcome Death and attain Salvation.  This  is the goal give to this work by the scriptures:  "If ye live after the flesh,  ye must die."

    The man who lives passively under the first law, insensibly and without being  aware of it  - even as an excellent citizen - involves himself in "The broad  way that leadeth to destruction; he who chooses the Law of Exception takes :  "The narrow road that leadeth to life."

Commentary on Boris Mouravieff's Gnosis

The cult of Demeter which celebrated the Eleusinian rites was well established in Mycenaea in the 13th century BC, and it is more than likely that the Feast of Tabernacles in Canaan was an offshoot of this activity. Our sources of information regarding the Eleusinian Mysteries include the ruins of the sanctuary there; numerous statues, bas reliefs, and pottery. We also have reports from ancient writers such as Aeschylos, Sophocles, Herodotus, Aristophanes, Plutarch, and Pausanias - all of whom were initiates - as well as the accounts of Christian commentators like Clement of Alexandria, Hippolytus, Tertullian, and Astorias, who were critics and not initiates. Yet for all this evidence, the true nature of the Mysteries remains shrouded in uncertainty because the participants were remarkably steadfast in honoring their pledge not to reveal what took place in the Telesterion, or inner sanctum of the Temple of Demeter. To violate that oath of secrecy was a capital offense. For these reasons,scholars today must make use of circumstantial evidence and inferences, with the result that there is still no consensus as to what did or did not take place.

Many experts have concluded - probably erroneously - that the Mysteries at Eleusis originally must have come from Egypt. The fact is, the sanctuary ruins in Eleusis evidently go back centuries earlier than the Egyptian Hymn to Demeter recited by Homer that is often cited as the proof that the origin was Egyptian. What is more, the excavations have unearthed no Egyptian artifacts there from that period.

Many scholars today favor the view that the cult of Demeter probably derived from Thessaly or Thrace. They base this conclusion partly on references in Homer and other ancient authors to some evidently pre-Dorian temples to Demeter in the Thessalian towns of Thermopylae, Pyrasos, and Pherai; partly on certain etymological links connecting key words in the rites of Demeter to pre-Hellenic dialects from the north . Other scholars point out that Demeter may be the same as a goddess "Dameter," who is mentioned briefly in Linear B tablets from Pylos dating from approximately 1200 BC. This evidence suggests that the cult of Demeter may after all have originated in the southern Peleponnesus.

In any case, whether the specific cult of Demeter at Eleusis originated in northern or southern Greece, the undeniable parallels with worship of grain goddesses in other parts of the eastern Mediterranean region point to frequent contacts and the cross-fertilization of religious ideas. And we certainly think that the Canaanite Feast of Tabernacles was a corrupted version of some more ancient form.

As it happens, the term "Thesmophoria" is derived from thesmoi, meaning "laws," and phoria, "carrying," in reference to the goddess as "law-bearer." But the symbolism of the ark as the "law bearer" in the "tent of meeting," or the "Mother-Delta," the "doorway to the higher realms," replaced the original meaning and the role of women in the process. Based on our own researches, we believe that True Christianity - which is almost virtually unknown today - was a resurgence of a very ancient Tradition - and that this same Tradition was preserved, in part, in Shamanic lore, was part of the Cathar beliefs as well as the true meaning of the Grail legends.

Jessie L. Weston writes in From Ritual to Romance:

    The more closely one studies pre-Christian Theology, the more strongly one is impressed with the deeply and daringly spiritual character of its speculations, and the more doubtful it appears that such teaching can depend upon the unaided processes of human thought, or can have been evolved from such germs as we find among the supposedly 'primitive' peoples... Are they really primitive? Or are we dealing, not with the primary elements of religion, but with the disjecta membra of a vanished civilization?

    Certain it is that so far as historical evidence goes our earliest records point to the recognition of a spiritual, not of a material, origin of the human race. Students of the Grail literature cannot fail to have been impressed by a certain atmosphere of awe and mystery which surrounds that enigmatic Vessel. There is a secret connected with it, the revelation of which will entail dire misfortune on the betrayer. [...] It is so secret a thing that no woman, be she wife or maid, may venture to speak of it.

    There is no doubt that the Grail was something secret, mysterious and awful, the exact knowledge of which was reserved to a select few. […] The Nature Cults still remain reliable guides; it is their inner, their esoteric, ritual which will enable us to bridge the gulf between what appears at first sight the wholly irreconcilable elements of Folk-tale and high Spiritual mystery."

In our work on Noah, we have tracked the Grail legends back to prehistoric times - in Western Europe and Central Asia - via the very area emphasized in many other ancient myths, including that of Jason and the Argonauts: Colchis and the Caucasus regions. Mircea Eliade writes:

    Recent researches have clearly brought out the "shamanic" elements in the religion of the paleolithic hunters. Horst Kierchner has interpreted the celebrated relief at Lascaux as a representation of a shamanic trance. The same author considers that the "kommandostabe" - mysterious objects found in prehistoric sites - are drumsticks. If this interpretation is accepted, the prehistoric sorcerers would already have used drums comparable to those of the Siberian shamans.

    Finally, Karl J. Narr has reconsidered the problem of the "origin" and chronology of shamanism in his important study. He brings out the influence of notions of fertility (Venus statuettes) on the religious beliefs of the prehistoric North Asian hunters; but this influence did not disrupt the paleolithic tradition. His conclusions are as follows: Animal skulls and bones found in the sites of the European Paleolithic (before 50,000 - ca. 30,000 BC) can be interpreted as ritual offerings. [...] Soon afterward, probably about 25,000 BC, Europe offers evidence for the earliest forms of shamanism (Lascaux) with the plastic representations of the bird, the tutelary spirit, and ecstasy. [...]

    What appears to be certain is the antiquity of "shamanic" rituals and symbols. It remains to be determined whether these documents brought to light by prehistoric discoveries represent the first expressions of a shamanism in statu nascendi or are merely the earliest documents today available for an earlier religious complex, which, however, did not find "plastic" manifestations (drawings, ritual objects, etc) before the period of Lascaux.[…]

    Everywhere in those lands, [ in Central and North Asia,] and from the earliest times, we find documents for the existence of a Supreme Being of celestial structure, who also corresponds morphologically to all the other Supreme Beings of the archaic religions. The symbolism of ascent, with all the rites and myths dependent on it, must be connected with celestial Supreme Beings; we know that "height" was sacred as such, that many supreme gods of archaic peoples are called "He on high," or "he of the Sky," or simply "Sky." This symbolism of ascent and "height" retains its value even after the "withdrawal" of the celestial Supreme Being - for, as is well known, Supreme Beings gradually lose their active place in the cult, giving way to religious forms that are more "dynamic" and "familiar" (the gods of storm and fertility, demiurges, the souls of the dead, the Great Goddesses, etc.) […]

    The reduction or even the total loss in religious currency of uranian Supreme Beings is sometimes indicated in myths concerning a primordial and paradisal time when communications between heaven and earth were easy and accessible to everyone; as the result of some happening, these communications were broken off and the Supreme Beings withdrew to the highest sky.[…]

    The disappearance of the cult of the celestial Supreme Being did not nullify the symbolism of ascent with all its implication. […] The shamanic ecstasy could be considered a reactualization of the mythical illud tempus when men could communicate in concreto with the sky. It is indubitable that the celestial ascent of the shaman is a survival, profoundly modified and sometimes degenerate, of this archaic religious ideology centered on faith in a celestial Supreme Being and belief in concrete communications between heaven and earth. […] The myths refer to more intimate relations between the Supreme Beings and shamans; in particular, they tell of a First Shaman, sent to earth by the Supreme Being or his surrogate to defend human beings against diseases and evil spirits.

    This historical change in the religions of Central and North Asia […] in turn altered the meaning of the shaman's ecstatic experience. Descents to the underworld, the struggle against evil spirits, the increasingly familiar relations with "spirits" that result in their "embodiment" or in the shaman's being "possessed" by "spirits," are innovations, most of them recent. In addition, there are the influences from the south, which appeared quite early and which altered both cosmology and the mythology and techniques of ecstasy. Among these southern influences we must reckon, in later times, the contribution of Buddhism and Lamaism, added to the Iranian and, in the last analysis, Mesopotamian influences that preceded them.

    The initiatory schema of the shaman's ritual death and resurrection is likewise an innovation, but one that goes back to much earlier times; in any case, it cannot be ascribed to influences from the ancient Near East. But the innovations introduced by the ancestor cult particularly affected the structure of this initatory schema. The very concept of mystical death was altered by the many and various religious changes effected by lunar mythologies, the cult of the dead, and the elaboration of magical ideologies.[including Egyptian]

    Hence we must conceive of Asiatic shamanism as an archaic technique of ecstasy whose original underlying ideology - belief in a celestial Supreme Being with whom it was possible to have direct relations by ascending into the sky - was constantly being transformed by a ongoing series of exotic contributions culminating in the invasion of Buddhism.

    The concept of mystical death, furthermore, encouraged increasingly regular relations with the ancestral souls and the "spirits," relations that ended in "possession." The phenomenology of the trance underwent many changes and corruptions, due in large part to confusion as to the precise nature of ecstasy. Yet all these innovations and corruptions did not succeed in eliminating the possibility of the true shamanic ecstasy.

    More than once we have discerned in the shamanic experience a "nostalgia for paradise" that suggests one of the oldest types of Christian mystical experience. As for the "inner light," which plays a part of the first importance in Indian mysticism and metaphysics as well as in Christian mystical theology, it is already documented in shamanism.

    But shamanism is important not only for the place that it holds in the history of mysticism. The shamans have played an essential role in the defense of the psychic integrity of the community They are preeminently the antidemonic champions; they combat not only demons and disease, but also the black magicians. [A shaman is a] tireless slayer of demons. The military elements that are of great importance in certain types of Asian shamanism (lance, cuirass, bow, sword, etc.) are accounted for by the requirements of war against the demons, the true enemies of humanity. In a way it can be said that shamanism defends life, health, fertility, the world of "light," against death, diseases, sterility, disaster, and the world of "darkness."[...]

    What is fundamental and universal is the shaman's struggle against what we could call "the powers of evil." […] The shaman's essential role in the defense of the psychic integrity of the community depends above all on this: men are sure that one of them is able to help them in the critical circumstances produced by the inhabitants of the invisible world. […] A member of the community is able to see what is hidden and invisible to the rest and to bring back direct and reliable information from the supernatural worlds.[…]

    We have already referred to the likenesses between the accounts of shamanic ecstasies and certain epic themes in oral literature. The shaman's adventures in the other world, the ordeals that he undergoes in his ecstatic descents below and ascents to the sky, suggest the adventures of the figures in popular tales and the heroes of epic literature. Probably a large number of epic "subjects" or motifs, as well as many characters, images, and cliches of epic literature, are, finally, of ecstatic origin, in the sense that they were borrowed from the narrative of shamans describing their journeys and adventures in the superhuman worlds. [ Eliade, Mircea, Shamanism, Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy.]

In short, we suggest that Esoteric Christianity - the REAL teachings of Jesus - were a revival of the most ancient of True Traditions of Freedom - an antediluvian tradition handed down from the Ancient Athenians of Plato's myth - the defenders of the world against the Evil Empire of Atlantis. This Evil Empire of Atlantis is reincarnated in the present day - the controlling empire of our world - and seeks to establish a One World control system exactly as Atlantis did ages ago. Part of the means of doing this includes brainwashing the masses, even those who are seeking alternative explanations in philosophy and religion. For those who seek outside the already corrupted standard religions, there is now the Stargate Conspiracy - the promotion of Egyptian and South American mysticism as the source of the Tradition. And it is a lie.

Christianity is quite interesting when one removes the obvious gloss of the Egyptian resurrection myth. When the reader is fully informed about the variations on these two themes, it is almost pathetically easy to read the New Testament and see what might be original to "Jesus," and what was added by the "creators" of Christianity as we know it.

What is even more interesting was the fact that the only writings contemporary to the times of early Christianity, which mention it specifically, remark that it is a "vile superstition." Yet, what we have as Christianity today, is nothing more or less than the same religious practices of the peoples who branded it a "vile superstition." Obviously something very strange happened between the times of the early Christians, and the times in which Christianity became the established religion. And whatever it was that happened, changed Christianity from a "vile superstition" to an acceptable, all-inclusive, monotheistic device. In short, it seems evident that "true Christianity" has completely disappeared from the world stage and those individuals who call themselves Christian are not, in fact, Christians in the original sense of the word by any stretch of the imagination.

The question that comes to mind is: what would the peoples of that time have considered a "vile superstition," when one is aware of what they considered normal religious practice? The only thing that seemed to fit the bill, so to say, is the possibility that whoever was the figure around which the Jesus legend was wrapped, was teaching that the "God of this world" was an "evil magician." Not only that, but that he probably suggested that man is the manifestation of God, and all creation is the "body of God," and that there was no point in praying to an "external god" at all. Now that would have set just about everybody back then on fire! To suggest that sacrifice to the gods, that appeasing the gods, that honoring the gods, that praying to the gods, that expecting to be saved by or cleansed from sin by any of the gods, was a waste of time would have been absolute heresy to all of the many religions! For them, such an idea, and only such an idea, would have been most definitely a "vile superstition."

In fact, we have something of a parallel in some remarks about Pythagoras. He was accused of believing the "vile superstitions" of the barbarians, that a soul is born over and over again into different bodies as opposed to the nonsense of the Egyptians that induced them to place all their hopes in a physical resurrection, for which purpose they went to such extremes as attempting to preserve their bodies for that future resurrection!

Clement of Alexandria writes:

    These are the times of the oldest wise men and philosophers among the Greeks. And that the most of them were barbarians by extraction, and were trained among barbarians, what need is there to say? Pythagoras is shown to have been either a Tuscan or a Tyrian. And Antisthenes was a Phrygian. And Orpheus was an Odrysian or a Thracian. The most, too, show Homer to have been an Egyptian. Thales was a Phoenician by birth, and was said to have consorted with the prophets of the Egyptians; as also Pythagoras did with the same persons, by whom he was circumcised, that he might enter the adytum and learn from the Egyptians the mystic philosophy. He held converse with the chief of the Chaldeans and the Magi; and he gave a hint of the church, now so called, in the common hall which he maintained. And Plato does not deny that he procured all that is most excellent in philosophy from the barbarians; and he admits that he came into Egypt.

    Whence, writing in the Phaedo that the philosopher can receive aid from all sides, he said: "Great indeed is Greece, O Cebes, in which everywhere there are good men, and many are the races of the barbarians."[…]

    And in the Symposium, Plato, landing the barbarians as practicing philosophy with conspicuous excellence, truly says: "And in many other instances both among Greeks and barbarians, whose temples reared for such sons are already numerous." And it is clear that the barbarians signally honoured their lawgivers and teachers, designating them gods. For, according to Plato, "they think that good souls, on quitting the supercelestial region, submit to come to this Tartarus; and assuming a body, share in all the ills which are involved in birth, from their solicitude for the race of men;" and these make laws and publish philosophy, "than which no greater boon ever came from the gods to the race of men, or will come.[…]

    And it is well known that Plato is found perpetually celebrating the barbarians, remembering that both himself and Pythagoras learned the most and the noblest of their dogmas among the barbarians.[…] [Circa AD 260-340]

But, as one notices when reading Clement, he has an agenda to validate Judaism and the New Covenant of Christianity. He identified "barbarians" as including Egyptians, Persian, Hindus, Babylonians, Phrygians, and so on. Again we find that all we can discover about the deeper beliefs of the ancient secret schools is what we hear from their detractors. In the end, Clement promoted the idea that the "true philosophy" was Hebrew, and that it was preserved most closely in the Egyptian "Mystery Schools." This twisting of the facts by someone with an agenda, has been the foundation for centuries of researchers to look in the wrong direction for the answers, and to follow the wrong clues regarding such things as the Ark of the Covenant and the Holy Grail.

The teaching of Jesus - whatever his real name was - was obviously this True Tradition, and was later corrupted and glossed by those who rewrote the Bible for purposes of power and control.

    But this is nothing new.  Time after time the Esoteric Tradition is misunderstood or deliberately buried, and so it dies.  Then, when the time is ripe, it must either be restored or rephrased.  In the meantime, the meaning is kept alive in communities or schools symbolized by the name "ark," of which Noah's Ark was one.

    A clear sign that the inner knowledge has been misunderstood is the idea that the inner knowledge is "secret."  This misunderstanding comes from a lack of comprehension of the term "inner" itself.  The impression is conveyed that these ideas are the possession of an "inner group" and are not to be given to others, when nothing could be further from the truth.  The real problem is due to what we now understand as "vectors of direction," the many "agents of the Matrix" in our reality who interpret the terminology in a purely material way, and promote their versions on the unsuspecting public.  An example is the case of the crucifixion itself.  The words that Paul used to describe "Christ crucified" have nothing to do with an historical event, and everything to do with an "inner event."  The crucifixion describes things which can and do happen within and between serious esoteric students and is a clear analogy for problems of the inner life of man which urgently require study.  Those who understand the crucifixion in a purely outward way, or who cling to the past as promoted by the Control System, miss the living tradition.

    As Jesus said:  "let the dead bury the dead."

    The fact is: inner knowledge is freely available to all those who are willing to look into themselves and face the pain that this brings.

Boris Mouravieff tells us that the Christian Esoteric Tradition has always remained alive within certain monasteries in Greece, Russia, and elsewhere.  It is true that this knowledge was hermetically hidden, but at the same time, its existence was known and access to it was never forbidden to those seriously interested in esoteric questions.

Mouravieff tells us that his commentaries are drawn directly from the Eastern Christian Tradition: the sacred texts, the commentaries written around these texts, and especially from the Philokalia which is, above all, the same teaching and discipline, transmitted by fully authorized individuals.

Attentive examination and comparison of Mouravieff's work to that of Ouspensky and Gurdjieff will show the incomplete character of the latter, as well as the deviations from the ancient doctrine.

    Christ categorically affirmed that entry into the Kingdom of God is closed to those who have not been born anew.  This second Birth is the object and goal of esoteric work.

Mouravieff tells us:

    The greatest genuine faith, human intelligence, and goodwill, are not sufficient to prevent errors and deviations in everything that touches the domain of Revelation.  The errors and deviations of Ouspensky's book [declared by Gurdjieff to have been accurate as far as it went] - attest to the fact that it was not written under the aegis of the Esoteric Brotherhood.  This means that the facts on which the book was based have a fragmentary character,  In the esoteric realm, all fragmentary knowledge is a source of danger.

As it was in the past, so it is in the present:  certain Gnostic schools, seeing the imperfection of the created world, and without searching for the reason for the existence of these imperfections, have, by a shortcut of thought, jumped to conclusions. One modern day example is the work of Dr. J.S. Chiappalone.

    The Tradition is One, whether it is the esoteric core of Hinduism, Buddhism, Sufism, or Sufism, and whoever delves deeply into these things cannot fail to note the Unity of the teachings.  All the great religions which have issued from the One Tradition are messages of truth - yet each of them addresses only part of humanity - parts with certain character.  Esoteric Christianity , in its perfect expression, aims at a general resurrection while other doctrines, even though they belong to the Truth, essentially aim at individual salvation and are therefore only partial revelations of the Tradition.

    Most of the writings of the Philokalia were intended for people who had already acquired some proficiency in esoteric studies.  One could actually say the same about the Gospels, corrupted and glossed though they be.  Bishop Theophan, in his preface to the Philokalia, insists on the fact that without help nobody can succeed in penetrating the doctrine.  This is why esoteric science conserves and cultivates an oral tradition which brings the letter to life.  Oriental Orthodoxy has known how to keep this Tradition intact by applying the absolute rule of Hermetism in each particular case.  From generation to generation, ever since the time of the Apostles, it has led its disciples up to mystic experience.

    If Hermetism has provided a safeguard for nearly twenty centuries, it must be said that circumstances have now changed.  At the current point in history, as at the time of the Coming of Christ, the veil has been partially raised.  Therefore, for those who want to advance beyond book knowledge, which never goes beyond the domain of information; for those who intensely seek the true sense of life, who want to understand the significance of the mission of those who labor in the vineyards of the Lord at the time of the Harvest, the possibility exists for initiation into this divine Wisdom, mysterious and hidden.

Mouravieff tells us that clarity of the New Testament can be extracted from obscurity by comparison to the Slavonic texts.  There are two reasons for this.  The first is that the translation of the New Testament into Slavonic was done at a time when the spirit of the texts still remained close to the original meaning.  The second is that the fixed nature of the Slavonic languages, Russian in particular, remain very close to the old Slavonic language which is still in used in the divine service of the Orthodox religion in the Slavic countries.

    The Slavonic text is generally attributed to Constantine the Philosopher, also known as St. Cyril, and to his brother St. Methodius, both learned Greeks from Salonika.  Arriving in Chersonese of Tauric, St. Cyril found, in the ninth century, that the Gospels were already written in this language, suggesting that they were produced in a period when the forms remained alive - as stated by the apostle St. Andrew, who taught Christianity in Russia in the first century of the present era… close to the time of the events.

Mouravieff notes that all serious esoteric teaching, as in ordinary education, is almost uniform.

    It is generally accepted that nobody can go on to secondary school without having completed an elementary education.  Nor can a person be admitted to a university without having a secondary education.  These graduations automatically "select" those able to become active members of the cultural elite of human society.

    Exactly the same is true in the esoteric Tradition.

    However, in our modern world, we encounter a curious phenomenon.  For example: we would not seek to discuss Newton's binomial theorem without having studied algebra, for without this, every opinion we expressed on the subject would be worthless.

Yet, in the esoteric field, we find a host of "experts" who declare their opinions on esotericism without having ever learned even the rudiments of this knowledge.

    At the same time, some of them demand "simplicity" from esoteric teachings on the generally accepted principle that Truth itself must be simple.  They conclude from this that access to Truth ought to likewise be simple.  Then they assert that the methods to access Truth must be easily assimilable.

    This argument would be perfectly correct if human beings and the problems they face were simple and just.  However, that is not the case.  There is a long road to travel from our state of distorted inner disorder to any "original simplicity."

    In practice, the doctrine of "simplicity" - if regarded as an axiom - turns the student aside from the strait gate and the narrow way that leads to Life.  Impelled by this counter-truth, he believes he stands before this door, when he is in reality - although undoubtedly in perfectly good faith - walking the wide path that leads to perdition, ad majorem Diaboli gloriam, of course.

    The Doctrine of Simplicity, correct in itself, but wrongly interpreted, becomes a snare for hearts and minds that are already too corrupt; a danger which should be recognized and avoided.

    Some people complain that the subject of the fundamentals of esotericism is not simple.  Others have said that it leads to great clarity.  This apparent contradiction is explained by the fact that esotericism is addressed to readers who are predisposed to esoteric culture by their nature, formation or personal experience.

        Jesus said: "Beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves."  And then he adds:  "You shall know them by their fruits."

    It is difficult, if not impossible, for an esoterically unevolved person to discern false prophets spontaneously.  He will recognize them more easily by their "fruits," by the observable results of their works, which serve as signs.  The Tradition knows and teaches a whole Science of signs.

        Jesus further said:  "Temptations (snares, traps set to entice to sin) are sure to come, but woe to him by or through whom they come!  It would be more profitable for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were hurled into the sea than that he should cause to sin or be a snare…"

    This warning is disturbing, but its value is real.  A thief can carry off our wealth; a 'ravening wolf' can deprive us of salvation. 

    That 'ravening wolves' appear in sheep's clothing we shall learn from the following text, well-phrased to frighten us:

        "It is not everyone that saith unto me:  Lord, Lord, who shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that accomplishes the will of my Father which is in Heaven.  Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name?  And in thy name have cast out devils?  And in thy name done many wonderful works?  And then I shall declare unto them, I never knew you: depart from Me, ye who work iniquity."

    The conclusion is that neither prophecies that are fulfilled nor the occurrence of miracles give us any surety against 'ravening wolves.'

        And in our own times: "There shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they should deceive the very elect."

    Our era is the time of Transition.  We are in the heart of this period, which is relatively short.  All the signs show that the necessary conditions for the End are emerging before our very eyes.

    This time brings with it a great preparatory task for the transition to the approaching Cycle of the Holy Spirit.  The preparatory task fundamental to the Time of Transition can and must be accomplished under the Aegis of the Absolute, for human beings and BY human beings.  Success depends upon the emergence in the near future of a sufficient number of people belonging to a new human type - torch bearers who have an innate predisposition for esoteric work.  And, it is Women who must play the inspirational role in this difficult time of Transition leading to the promised era of redemption.

    The objective of esoteric work is the march towards Consciousness, which means towards Truth.  The final aim that man can hope to achieve by esoteric work is to attain the Second Birth and so overcome Death. 

    With rare exceptions, this aim can only be attained by the student through hared and methodical work.  The sum of the conscious efforts required is proportional to the degeneracy of the Personality.

    The discipline is accepted voluntarily, but it is of iron.  The student can abandon the work at any moment to return to worldly interests.

    The freedom of choice and the initiative demanded of the seeker bring a danger: that of taking the false for the true; the impure for the pure, allowing himself to become subject to traps and snares.  When such errors are made by the pure in heart, they will be warned in time, even if they persist in their error. 

    The real danger, which can lead to mortal sin, to a definite check, occurs when an impure heart seeks to be served by higher psychic forces for its own egoistic ends.  This is a quagmire.

    A curious phenomenon often occurs in the human mind when it considers the generally hermetized theories and facts of the esoteric realm.

    In any field of science, pure, moral, applied, it is generally accepted that we must be well versed in a subject before we can give a valid opinion.  To speak seriously, one must speak of what one knows, which presupposes previous studies.

    In the esoteric domain, many purveyors of "esoteric science" believe themselves to be competent without even completing an elementary education.  They may receive all kinds of "insights" and messages from all kinds of sources, but the problem with that is that they judge these messages and teachings to be positive or true before they have even developed within themselves the correct instrument with which to judge.

    The problem is:  we KNOW that any given thing can only be conceived, understood and judged by something similar or higher.  Without this, all judgments, discussions and advice about esoteric facts remain comparable to evaluations and opinions about the shade of a specific color by someone born blind.

    Just as the world we live in is closed off, invisible to the fetus in its mother's womb until the awakening of its birth, even so the higher planes of Life, the astral and spiritual, are similarly closed and invisible to us until the Second Birth.  Until then, man can only form hypotheses or refer to the testimony of authors who have themselves been Twice born.

    As for passing valid judgments of these facts, no one can do this until he has himself crossed the second Threshold. 

    What seems clear is that it is commonplace these days for people of perfectly good faith to persist in their ignorant attitudes about esotericism.  This phenomenon is due to two principle causes.  One is the general tendency of humans to claim qualities which exist in them only in potential, and the second - a consequence of the first - is the deification of Personality.  Without doing any real, prolonged work, they "trust themselves" or rely on their own "truth" to guide them. 

    We are not speaking here of people of bad faith; we are speaking of sincere people who stray into gross error.  Their case is precisely that of the sick in need of a physician.  They are small "Sauls" who could be converted to small "Pauls," and thus might become useful laborers and earn a reward in the fields of the Lord.  But they wander in their searching beyond the place where they could receive compensation for the work that they have done.

    In esoteric work the phenomenalist mentality seeks facts.  It looks for manifestations that confirm that its work is well founded, or which simply satisfy its curiosity.  This is where the snares and traps and greatest dangers lie.  For it is often possible to obtain the desired "facts" quite easily from the astral realms, to which the human personality also belongs.  When the personality is firmly anchored in the physical body it is generally incapable of making direct connection with the astral levels.  However, certain persons, known as sensitives, have the innate or acquired faculty of momentarily weakening the ties of the personality to the physical body so that, with no esoteric evolution whatever, they are able to connect with this level - connecting to the coarsest levels of the astral.

    "Facts" obtained this way are often regarded by people who seek them as coming from the spiritual level.  However, this level is a vast reservoir of psychic entities that have no contact with the higher plane, including amongst them discarnate Personalities, who normally remain there to await their Second Death - the negative equivalent of the Second Birth.  This usually occurs on the fortieth day after death of the physical body.

    The Tradition expressly warns seekers against contacts with this realm which is so dangerous and full of the worst illusions. 

    The power of intervention of these entities in the lives of humans is a function of the credulity they meet.  The yearning to experience miracles, visions, etc, creates an atmosphere favorable for their appearance, which can assume various forms, often perceptible to the physical senses.

    In the materialist mind of the cultured man of our era, the true and the false in esoteric research easily become mixed together.  This entanglement shows above all in the domain of our affections, which are generally unbalanced in us because the habit of lying has become our true second nature.  The innate faculty of immediate discernment of the true from the false is thus lost, and man, even the most cultured and learned, becomes singularly credulous, particularly in the mystical realm.

    This imbalance affects us according to law:  credulity is inversely proportional to true faith. 

And here we must define faith: 

    Faith is an openness and trusting attitude to truth and reality, whatever it may turn out to be.  This is a risky and adventurous state of mind.  Belief, in the religious sense, is the opposite of faith – because it is a fervent wishing or hope, a compulsive clinging to the idea that the universe is arranged and governed in such and such a way.  Belief is holding to a rock; faith is learning how to swim – and this whole universe swims in boundless space.[1]

In other words, the less open we are to truth and reality, the more our credulity grows and the more we are inclined to adopt "beliefs" and rituals, often taking grotesque forms. In this mechanism we can see the familiar action of the General Law of Accident which is the essence of the Matrix: 

    To inspire the man who seeks the Way with the idea that he is already on the way.  This is the best and the most common means used by the "Devil" to turn away the seeker who has had insufficient warning from the narrow way which leads to Life.  Jesus asked:

        How can ye believe which receive glory from one another, and seek not the glory that comes from God only?

    When we accept the "glory of men," yet still believe that we are on or walking on the Way, we fall directly under the law of equilibrium.  Jesus alluded to this when he quoted the Pharisees who prayed in the streets, saying that "they have already received their reward."

    It is well understood that the human Personality, in the unfinished state in which we find it, forms our only instrument for esoteric work.  Better still, it is a gift; it is the talent the Master has given us so that we may make it bear fruit.  Woe to the servant who buries it in the earth of his body.  "Cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth."  And here, this is no metaphor. 

    We must therefore work with love and with all our strength since we do not know at what hour the Master will come.

     This being so, the attitude of the esoteric Doctrine towards lying is clear  and realistic.  ...We must fight energetically against .. useless lies.

    It is only by training of this nature that we shall progressively be able to  master the rooted tendency to lie which exists within us.  Every attempt to  hurry things, so far as lying to others is concerned, though it be a noble  attempt, is doomed to early failure.  We live in a world which is immersed in  lies and moved by lies.

    It is also necessary to guard against a variant of the habit of lying to  ourselves, one which we commonly adopt from early childhood, and against which  we must fight by every means.  This variant is widespread because at first  glance it appears to us to be a positive attitude.  ...When applied to  ourselves and for our own benefit, with the aim of softening a shock, or  regaining our inner peace after we have sinned, or excusing our actions or  faults, this idiom crystallizes within us over a period of time an auto- tranquilizing mechanism.  ...It is a true mechanism of mental anesthesia,  founded on a refined and disguised lie.  It sows hypocrisy in man towards  himself.

    This auto-tranquillizer must be destroyed."

But we see so often how desperately people want to be "tranquilize."  How  many individuals have written to us asking for an answer that would help  them feel peaceful and enable them to go to sleep at night.  They want  "positive messages."  They want a program of meditation that will make them  feel good, or something to do or "look forward to" that will ease their anxiety  when they glimpse, momentarily, the reality of the Matrix.  They want to feel  chosen and special by virtue of having been "contacted" and performing rituals without doing the absolutely agonizing work necessary to precipitate transformation.

Mouravieff continues:

    The permanent link which must be introduced between the Personality and the  real "I" is esoteric Knowledge.  The knowledge and understanding that it  permits us to acquire represent the philosopher's stone of the medieval  mystics.  They are capable of provoking in man the transmutation to which he  aspires.

    We must work ceaselessly, for fear of not succeeding in time.  One must work,  says Jesus,  "while it is day: the night comes when no man can work."

These commentaries of Mouravieff are absolutely invaluable, and would be helpful to every seeker on the path and reader of the Cassiopaean Material.  This is especially so because Mouravieff actually describes  things that  we have already experienced, even though we did not precisely  understand what it was we were doing, how or even why.

For example,  Mouravieff calls the influences of the material world, the Matrix, the  predator's mind, etc, the "A influences."  (He has diagrams showing how they  affect the consciousness.)  The influences of the esoteric center, the "real  world" concealed by the "matrix illusion," the "truth," are called "B  influences." 

He writes:

    If a man spends his life without distinguishing between "A" and "B"  influences, he will end as he started, one could say mechanically, driven by  the Law of Accident.  ...He can have a brilliant career in the meaning the  world gives to this expression.  Yet he will come to the end of his days  without having either learned or understood anything of the Reality.  And dust  returns to dust.

    In life, every being is subjected to a sort of competitive test.  If he  discerns the existence of the "B" influences; if he acquires a taste for  gathering and absorbing them; if he continually aspires to assimilate them  better; his mixed inner nature will slowly undergo a certain kind of evolution.

    And if the efforts which he makes to absorb the "B" influences are constant  and sufficient in force, a magnetic centre can be formed within him. 

    If this center once born in him is carefully developed, it takes form, and in  its turn will exercise an influence over the results of the "A" influences  which are always active, deflecting them.

    Such deflection may be violent.  In general it transgresses the laws of  exterior life and provokes many conflicts in and around man.  If he loses the  battle, he emerges with the conviction the the "B" influences are nothing but  illusion: that the only reality is represented by the "A" influences.  Slowly,  the magnetic center which had been formed within him is reabsorbed and  vanishes.  Then, from the esoteric point of view, his situation is worse than  the one he had started with, when he was just beginning to discern "B"  influences.

    But, if he emerges a winner in this FIRST struggle, his magnetic centre,  consolidated and reinforced, will draw him to a man having a "C" influence  stronger than his own, and possessing a stronger magnetic center.  And so on in  succession, the last man being in connection with another having in influence  "D", who will be his link with the Esoteric Center "E."

    Henceforth in life, that man will no longer be isolated. 

    To the measure of its growth, the man will escape the dominion of the law of  accident and enter the domain of consciousness.

Mouravieff then shows a diagram of the person who deludes himself and does not  struggle against the lies of the Matrix... who has not engaged in the work of  stripping away lies:

    This second figure, with black magnetic centers, represents the situation  where man deludes himself and, believing he is absorbing "B" influences and  making the necessary selection all the while, he in fact absorbs "A"  influences... This will put him into contact with people who possess magnetic  centers of the same nature: who are themselves duped or who dupe others, and  who have no direct or indirect link with the esoteric Center.

In both the Wave Series and the Adventure Series, we have been dealing with identifying these very influences and emphasizing the necessity of "collecting" the "A" influences in terms of "seeing the unseen" of what we have called the Theological Reality. We have also met many characters that are aptly described by Mouravieff in his diagram of those individuals who have deluded themselves and have created a magnetic center of negativity, and how they attract to themselves others with similar negative magnetic centers.

In other words, the activities described in the Adventures series - the constant questioning,  stripping, looking at what is difficult and dealing with it - the shocks of  seeing the Matrix, the "man behind the curtain," the effort to "see the unseen"  is the very activity of collecting these "B" influences which then lead to the  "magnetic center," or "lodestar," as the C's called it.

    Q: When I post material on the website, those people who resonate to the material believe that this refers to them also. I have been of the opinion that Unified Thought Form being must mean a very large group as represented in this density. I know that we are dealing with limiting terms. But, is this applied to people who CHOOSE the Cassiopaean option?
    A: Maybe it is best to say it applies to those who recognize the application.
    Q: So, if they recognize it, if they know it is them, they are part of it. (A) But, thinking in nonlinear terms, its up to us to work to make this precise. You are asking this question which implies that the answer exists. But, exactly what the answer is may be it is not yet chosen, and it is up to us to make it this way.
    A: Lodestar is a clue for you.

Mouravieff writes:

    This evolution seems a long process, an uninterrupted combat with a series of  successes and falls.  More than once, he who searches will fall into crises of  discouragement; more than once it will seem to him that he is being driven  beyond the limits of his own life; he will sometimes feel crushed under the  burden of the tests and difficulties against which he will be pitted during his  search. 

    This can be understood when we know that esoteric science in its teaching goes  far beyond simple information.  Its purpose, in fact, is nothing less than the  TRANSFORMATION of the very being of those who study it...

    In every case where esoteric science offers ALL, it demands ALL in return.  One  must pay all.

    It is impossible to reach the true by the path of lies or hypocritical games,  because in this case we seek to BE, rather than to "appear to be."

Mouravieff describes the reaction of the "matrix/ B influences" to the person  who is on the Path:

    As long as man accepts the principle of the final annihilation of his  Personality without a fight, he can carry on in life without attracting the  increasing pressure of the General Law of Accident upon himself.

    The case is totally different if he struggles to surpass the limits which it  imposes.  He then runs against the action upon him of this Law and its  derivatives.  It acts simultaneously on several planes: physical, mental and  moral.  Its action on the moral plane is conceived by man, since time  immemorial, in the form of the personification: the Devil."

We are also reminded of Gurdjieff's remarks about the "mechanical force"  having promoters and adherents at very high levels who act under its powerful  influences.  We suggest that both are 4 and 5 D STS beings.

    ...Once the first positive results are obtained those students will  unmistakable run up against the active opposition of the law and the "game of  the Crafty One."

    It must be realized that in placing himself under the aegis of the Law of  Exception, man goes against the General Law of Accident, which he is even   called upon to overthrow, if only on the individual scale.  He must no forget -  under penalty of "surprise attack" - that salvation depends on victory over the  Devil, which, as we have said, is the personalized moral aspect of the General  Law of Accident.  This is so even though this, being a cosmic law, is naturally  a divine law. 

    One must not be afraid, as the Law of Exception is also a divine law.

    In choosing it, man continues to serve the interest of the whole, but  differently and in an incomparably more efficient manner.

    During his fight against the first law, he is subject to tests that often take  the form of temptations.  ...We are permitted to draw attention to the indirect  nature of diabolical action.

    If, aiming straight towards his goal, which is liberation and salvation, the  seeker successfully overcomes the obstacles and by this shows proof of a  strength that would permit him to defy the authority of the General Law, the  latter will begin to act upon him indirectly, generally by the mediation of his  near ones if they do not follow the same path:  this action occurs on the moral  plane, and often takes emotional forms appealing to his most noble, generous  and disinterested sentiments: to his charity; his obligation; his pity.  It  impels him down blind alleys, insinuating that he will thus be returning to his  duty, that by so doing he will go on walking in the right path, etc. 

    This will clarify the profound saying of Jesus that : "A man's worst enemies  are those of his own household."

    Let us repeat:  esoteric work is by its nature a revolutionary work.  The  seeker seeks a change of state: to overcome Death and attain Salvation.  This  is the goal give to this work by the scriptures:  "If ye live after the flesh,  ye must die."

    The man who lives passively under the first law, insensibly and without being  aware of it  - even as an excellent citizen - involves himself in "The broad  way that leadeth to destruction; he who chooses the Law of Exception takes :  "The narrow road that leadeth to life."

Commentary on Boris Mouravieff's Gnosis

Boris Mouravieff writes in his book "Gnosis: Study and commentaries on the Esoteric tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy. Book I, Exoteric Cycle"

    Homo Sapiens lives immersed in his everyday life to a point where he forgets himself and forgets where he is going; yet, without feeling it, he knows that death cuts off everything.

    How can we explain that the intellectual who has made marvelous discoveries and the technocrat who has exploited them have left outside the field of their investigations the ending of our lives? How can we explain that a science which attempts everything and claims everything nevertheless remains indifferent to the enigma revealed by the question of death? How can we explain why Science, instead of uniting its efforts with its older sister religion to resolve the problems of Being - which is also the problem of death - has in fact opposed her?

    Whether a man dies in bed or aboard an interplanetary ship, the human condition has not changed in the slightest.

    Happiness? But we are taught that happiness lasts only as long as the Illusion lasts... and what is this Illusion? Nobody knows. But it submerges us.

    If we only knew what Illusion is, we would then know the opposite: what Truth is. This Truth would liberate us from slavery.

This last remark seems to me to be important. Very often people write to me and say that the C's material is too "scary" and that we talk too much about the "illusion" why aren't we talking about positive things or concentrating on "escaping" or whatever.

Well, the fact seems to be that what Mouravieff has said above is the key: If we cannot map the illusion, we have no hope of getting out of it. It is in mapping the illusion that we are able to distinguish between what Mouravieff calls the "A" influences and the "B" influences. We call it seeing the Theological Reality behind the Matrix. Mouravieff points out that the more we "collect" or "perceive" the "B" influences, and act on them, the more we "magnetize." And naturally, SEEing the "A" influences, or discerning the lies of our reality, consists in an ongoing series of "shocks" that seem to be necessary to change our center of gravity.

When I was spending years struggling my way through this material - in real time - up close and personal, I wailed about it to the C's:

    Q: (L) I want you guys to know that I sometimes feel a wee tiny bit like a pawn on a chessboard!
    A: You should, you inhabit 3rd density STS environment.
    Q: (L) I was at least hoping that if I was a pawn, that some of the players were good guys. Is that asking too much?
    A: Yes.
    Q: (L) To which statement?
    A: Good guys don't play chess.
    Q: (L) But there have been so many strange events, so many synchronous events. Is that the good guys helping or the bad guys leading me astray?
    A: Neither. It is Nature running its course.
    Q: (L) Okay. One of the sensations I have experienced is that I have had it up to the eyebrows with the negative energies and experiences of 3rd density, and I have thought lately that this feeling of having had enough, in an absolute sense, is one of the primary motivators for wanting to find one's way out of this trap we are in. I want out of it. Is this part of this "nature" as you call it?
    A: Yes. [...] When you see the futility of the limitations of 3rd density life, it means you are ready to graduate. Notice those who wallow in it.
    Q: (L) Some people obviously wallow in extreme materiality. And there seems to be another kind that is more subtle, which has to do with saying that you want to grow and become enlightened, and yet such a person is unable to pierce the veil of their own illusions about how to become enlightened, and this illusion is the wallowing...
    A: Wallowing takes many forms.

    Q: (L) Well, you say that, but it is, as several people have pointed out to me, only since we have begun this channeling project that all these dreadful things have happened in my life. My life is a shambles!
    A: "Dreadful is subjective."
    Q: (L) I would say that the physical things that have happened to me, the collapse of my marriage, the things that have happened to my children, are pretty damn dreadful, subjectively or otherwise!
    A: Before these changes began to manifest, you were deeper into the "deadly illusion" than you are now. Emergence is, by its very nature, uncomfortable. But, it has and will, empower you, we promise!!!!!!!!
    Q: (L) It is a very trying time now. I am having a difficult time just coping.
    A: And there have been others, and will be others, but that does not mean that the rewards will be slight.
    Q: (L) Well...
    A: You are on a path of destiny, and there is no turning back now.

    Q: (L) This recent 'awakening' or period of seeing things with such clarity, as they really were, and the whole picture of the interactions between people and how truly ugly it can be. I plunged into a terrible depression. I needed to get my balance from seeing so much all at once. Can you explain to me what was going on?
    A: Growth.
    Q: (L) I tried to share this perception with other people, and almost without exception, when I said to people that I was finally seeing things in their true state and it was NOT a pretty picture, they all said "well, you are obviously seeing this through the eyes of some major spirit possession!" Why would they say this?
    A: First of all, it is not correct to perceive "everything in such darkness and gloom, etc." That is merely the result of a cocoon of falsehood being removed. Celebrate the balance. Don't mourn the death of an illusion of an imbalance.
    Q: (L) Where do I go from here? Where do we all go?
    A: Everywhere.

The point is that it seems that until a person fully SEES the illusion - the layers and layers of it - they have no hope of becoming free of it. Until we are trained, step by step, to discern the lies from the truth, we have no internal consistency and are subject to the whims of the Control System at every turn. And it seems to be that this patient, time-consuming, taking apart of our reality and extracting the Truth/"B" influences is what literally "grows" the soul.

Many people simply can't do it. They can't stand the bloody mess of the birth of the higher self which takes place on the bodies of all the sacred cows that were held so close for so long. They want to hear nice stories about how their breathing and spinning tetrahedrons are going to just fix them right up. They want to hear how the "Guardian Alliance" is going to help us out of the soup. They want to hear how the Zetas are warning us that we are in danger of being smacked by a rogue planet and if we ask real nice, we might get a seat on the airlift out.

As Mouravieff has just said: "If we only knew what Illusion is, we would then know the opposite: what Truth is. This Truth would liberate us from slavery."

And it seems that the only way we have of discovering Truth in this reality, is to first of all strip away all the lies. And Lord! There's a raft of them!

Now, back to Mouravieff:

    What strikes us from the very beginning is that man confuses moral progress with technical progress, so that the development of science continues in dangerous isolation.

    The brilliant progress that has come from technology has changed nothing essential in the human condition, and will change nothing, because it operates only in the field of everyday events. For this reason it touches the inner life of man only superficially. Yet from very ancient times it has been known that the essential is found within man, not outside him.

    Humanity has arrived at an important turning point in its history. The Cartesian spirit which destroyed scholastic philosophy is now in turn being left behind. The logic of history demands a new spirit. The divorce between traditional knowledge, of which religion is a trustee, and acquired knowledge, the fruit of science, threatens to make sterile our civilization.

    Yet it is an aberration to believe that Science by its very nature is opposed to [spirit], and it must also be firmly stressed that [spirit] does not include any tendency opposed to Science. On the contrary, the [mystics] foresaw the prodigious development of Science.

    The celebrated formula of St. Paul: Faith, Hope and Love, summarizes a vast programme of evolution for human knowledge. If we examine this formula in relation to its context we see that the first two terms are temporary, while the third is permanent. [...] It was appropriate to the epoch in which it was expressed, and its significance has had to evolve with time. [...] Science and knowledge are called on to replace Faith and Hope, which defined the limits of what was accessible to the mentality of the epoch when he taught - have since then known extraordinary development.

    He therefore adds: "Now that I have become a man, I have put away childish things."

    This is how the passage from Faith to Knowledge is described. [Faith being appropriate to that time, Science replacing Faith in our time.]

    St. Paul then specifies that this last, although necessary in evolution, is NOT a final state, as it is incomplete by nature. He adds that "When that which is perfect is come, that which is incomplete disappears."

    The perfect is Love, which unites in itself the accomplishment of all virtues, of all prophecies, of all mysteries, and of all Knowledge.

    It is by the joint efforts of traditional science, based on Revelation, and of acquired Science, the domain of positive knowledge, that is, on "Faith and Hope," that one can hope to fulfill the programme traced out by St. Paul, and finally attain Love in its integral meaning."

The work of Mouravieff was only translated into English fairly recently, but Ark read them in French many years ago. He had forgotten much of what was in them because he had to read them with a dictionary and it was a slow and laborious process. But recently, when we found them in English, we ordered them and I have to tell you that reading some of the things in there really amazed me. As the author of the introduction to Mouravieff's books wrote: "It predicts, in what appears at first to be mere theory, the actual events of the life in the study of Gnosis." Mouravieff has certainly written a book that "predicts" much of what we have already experienced in our initiatory path guided by the Cassiopaeans. And this is what encourages us that Mouravieff's text consists of significant chunks of knowledge of a high order.

Indeed, even in reading Mouravieff we must discriminate. But it is apparent that there is information there that can assist the seeker to greater understanding of the process of spiritual transformation.

What struck me most forcibly was the fact that things that we KNOW because of experience, are described and explained by Mouravieff even though the experiences happened for us before reading the explanation. And even though Ark had read these books, those specific things that I want to quote here, had no meaning for him because they were - at the time - outside of his range of experiences.

Mouravieff talks about the degrading of women to "living merchandise" and how Jesus (as a Gnostic teacher) taught "reciprocal choice in love" which established the idea of "romance" between men and women. I have already noted that this seems to be philosophy of the "Golden Age," transmitted down through the ages via Archaic Shamanism, the Eleusinian Rites, and then later the True Teachings of Jesus, not to be confused with the Egyptian mythical overlay that is known as Christianity today.

"Reciprocal choice in love" is certainly a theme of the Grail stories with their emphasis on romance - on "platonic love" and so on - and it has long been a mystery as to what, precisely, this allegory was supposed to convey. If what Mouravieff is saying is true, then it will all begin to make perfect sense, even including the possible survival of the Cathar teachings in the Grail stories and the lays of the minstrels and Troubadours, etc.

Also, there is Fomenko's theory to consider - that much of the "history" of the Dark Ages in Europe is really the history of ancient Byzantium, the origin of the Grail stories, and the "path of transmission" of the ancient Gnostic traditions. That is not to say that we agree completely with what Fomenko has proposed. What is important is that he noticed that something was very strange with history and he sought an explanation. Unfortunately his explanation did not include hyperdimensional manipulations.

And of course, here is where we come to one of the big differences between the work of Gurdjieff and Mouravieff: Sex and sexuality. Gurdjieff's teachings on sexuality were quite different from the teachings of Mouravieff. Gurdjieff had said that there were three "centers" in the human being - (1)Intellectual Center (2)Emotional Center (3) Sex Center. The proper kind of sex, according to Gurdjieff, was when the Sex Center functioned with its own energy without "borrowing" energy from the other two centers. In other words, sex should be separated from the intellectual and emotional life of human beings, and love does not enter into his teachings on sexuality. Homosexuality is said to be incompatible with the Work on Oneself. Mouravieff suggests that when the magnetic center is established, it takes under its control ALL of the centers, including the sexual center.

And here we are not speaking of Tantra, as the reader will discover as we continue with this series of excerpts. However, it seems that the negative occult tradition has sought to promote the idea of Tantric sex as a means of "spiritualization." We believe that this is a complete misunderstanding of the principles.

Mouravieff writes:

    The romance, by which Christian society expressed the principle of reciprocal choice, reached its climax in the Middle Ages. In spite of the decline it has known since then, and in spite of a current tendency to return to regressive forms of relations between the sexes, it still remains the avowed ideal of our society.

    Is it not exact, then, to speak of the death of romance? A revolution is occurring silently which will replace the free romance, distinctive mark of the Christian era, with the singular romance characteristic of the Holy Spirit. Liberated from servitude to procreation, this romance of tomorrow is called on to cement the indissoluble union between two strictly polar beings, a union which will assure their integration in the bosom of the Absolute. As St. Paul says:

        "Nevertheless, neither is the woman without the man, nor man without the woman in the Lord."

    The vision of such a romance has haunted the highest minds for thousands of years. We find it in platonic love, the basis of the singular romance in the myths of Androgyne man; of Orpheus and Eurydice; of Pygmalion and Galatea... This is the aspiration of the human heart, which cries in secrecy because of its great loneliness. This romance forms the essential aim of esoteric work. Here is that love which will unite man to that being who is unique for him, the Sister-Wife, the glory of man, as he will be the glory of God. Having entered into the light of Tabor, no longer two, but one drinking at the fount of true Love, the transfigurer: the conqueror of Death.

    Love is the Alpha and Omega of life. All else has only secondary significance.

    Man is born with the Alpha. It is the intention of the present work to show the path which leads towards the Omega.

    When we ask someone who lives under this constant pressure of contemporary life to turn his mental vision towards himself, he generally answers that he has not enough time left to undertake such practices. ... If he acquiesces, he will in most cases say that he sees nothing: Fog; Obscurity. In less common cases, the observer reports that he perceives something which he cannot define because it changes all the time.

    This last observation is correct. Everything is in fact continually changing within us. A minor external shock, agreeable or disagreeable, happy or unhappy, is sufficient to give our inner content a quite different appearance.

    If we follow up this interior observation, this introspection, without prejudice, we will soon note that our "I" of which we are so consistently proud, is not always the same self: the "I" changes.

    As this impression becomes more defined we begin to become more aware that it is not a single being who lives within us but several, each having his own tastes, his own aspirations, and each trying to attain his own ends.

    If we proceed with this experience, we will soon be able to distinguish three currents with that perpetually moving life: that of the vegetative life of the instincts, so to speak; that of the animal life of the feelings; and lastly that of human life in the proper sense of the term, characterized by thought and speech.

    It is as though there were three beings within us, all entangled together in an extraordinary way.

    So we come to appreciate the value of introspection as a method of practical work which permits us to know ourselves and enter into ourselves.

    The inner content of man is analogous to a vase full of iron filings in a state of mixture as a result of mechanical action. Every shock received by the vase causes displacement of the particles of iron filings. Thus real life remains hidden from the human being due to the constant changes occurring in his inner life.

    Even so, as we shall see later, this senseless and dangerous situation can be modified in a beneficial way. But this requires work; conscientious and sustained effort. Introspection carried out relentlessly results in enhanced internal sensibility. This improved sensibility in its turn intensifies the amplitude and frequency of movement whenever the iron filings are disturbed. As a result, shocks that previously were not noticed will now provoke vivid reactions. These movements, because of their continuous amplification, can create friction between particles of iron so intense that we may one day feel the interior fire igniting within us.

    The fire must not remain a harmless flare-up. Nor is it enough that the fire smolders dormant under the ashes. A live and ardent fire once lit must be carefully kept alight by the will to refine and cultivate sensitiveness. If it continues in this way, our state can change: the heat of the flame will start a process of fusion within us.

Regarding this idea of the internal crucible, the C's have said:

    Q: (A) A related question concerning our internet activities which have been going on for some time, and we do it because we feel that it is necessary, but we don't really know or understand what is the real purpose of what we are doing. Some people are reading our pages and writing letters, and then they disappear or they are discouraged, or they do nothing on their own. We are expending a lot of time on this publishing of information, but without clear understanding of what we are supposed to accomplish by this. (L) At this point, it is not accomplishing a whole lot except drawing down fire on our heads! (A) Right!
    A: You should rejoice! From the fire comes light. Patience pays. You are on the right track.

Back to Mouravieff: 

    ...A live and ardent fire, once lit must be carefully kept alight by the will to refine and cultivate sensitiveness. If it continues in this way, our state can change: the heat of the flame will start a process of fusion within us.

    From this point on the inner content will no longer behave like a heap of iron filings: it will form a block. Then further shocks will no longer provoke interior change in man as they did previously. Having reached this point he will have acquired a firmness; he will remain himself in the midst of the tempests to which life may expose him.

    To reach this state, we must from the beginning rid ourselves of all illusions about ourselves, no matter how dearly held; an illusion - if it is tolerated at the start - will grow en route, so that suffering and additional effort will be necessary in order to rid ourselves of it at a later date.

    As long as man has not reached the point of fusion, his life will be in effect a factitious existence, as he himself will change from moment to moment. Since these changes will occur as a result of external shocks which he can almost never foresee, it will also be impossible for him to predict in advance the exact way he will change internally. thus he will live subject to events as they occur, always preoccupied by constantly "patching up". He will in fact progress toward the unknown, at the mercy of chance. This state of things is the principal law under whose authority he leads his illusory existence.

    Esoteric science indicates the possibilities and the means of freeing oneself from this law.

    But to begin effectively in this way, one must first clearly see the situation as it is.

The parable of the coach:

    The physical body is represented by the coach itself; the horses represent sensations, feelings and passions; the coachman is the ensemble of the intellectual faculties including reason; the person sitting in the coach is the master.

    In its normal state, the whole system is in a perfect state of operation: the coachman holds the reins firmly in his hands and drives the horses in the direction indicated by the master.

    This, however, is not how things happen [due, the C's say, to DNA modification]

    First of all, the master is absent. The coach must go and find him, and must then await his pleasure. All is in a bad state: the axles are not greased and they grate; the wheels are badly fixed; the shaft dangles dangerously; the horses, although of noble race, are dirty and ill-fed; the harness is worn and the reins are not strong. The coachman is asleep: his hands have slipped to his knees and hardly hold the reins, which can fall from them at any moment.

    The coach nevertheless continues to move forward, but does so in a way which presages no happiness. Abandoning the road, it is rolling down the slope in such a way that the coach is now pushing the horses, which are unable to hold it back. The coachman, fallen into a deep sleep, is swaying in his seat at risk of falling off. Obviously a sad fate awaits such a coach.

    This image provides a highly appropriate analogy for the condition of most human beings...

    Salvation may however present itself. Another coachman, this one quite awake, may pass by the same route and observe the coach in its sad situation. ... He may perhaps stop to help the coach that is in distress. He will first help the horses hold back the coach from slipping down the slope. Then he will awaken the sleeping driver and together with him will try to bring the coach back to the road.

    He will lend fodder and money. He might also give advice on the care of the horses, the address of an inn and a coach repairer, and indicate the proper route to follow.

    It will be up to the assisted coachman afterward to profit, by his own efforts, from the help and the information received. It will be incumbent on him from this point on to put all things in order and, open eyed, to follow the path.

    He will above all fight against sleep, for if he falls asleep again, and if the coach leaves the road again and again finds itself in the same danger, he cannot hope that chance will smile upon him a second time; that another coachman will pass at that moment and at that place and come to his aid once again.

    [...] Man reacts as much as possible against this constant pressure of the difficulties and obligations which weigh him down. As for the changes within him, he generally compensates for this by instinctive reactions: a fixed attitude to each situation. He wants at all costs at least to appear logical with himself and master of his actions.

    [...] It is because the friction between the particles of iron filings produces a disagreeable sensation in us that we feel the need to get rid of it. The movement of the iron filings stops when we find a solution and so ward off the shocks received. The discovery of a culprit will allow us this relief. As a result man appears to us to be constantly preoccupied with his interior patching up, which in time becomes almost wholly automatic within him.

    [...] There is an urgent necessity that man should become master of himself.

Here we skip a couple hundred pages where Mouravieff brings in some Synarchy stuff under the influence of the negative occult "tradition" which was very active at the time he was writing and has influenced many people to follow the wrong path. Without the C's perspective of 4th density and the principle of the Network, synarchy is just another "elitist hierarchy." Mouravieff and others did not understand the STS vs. STO principles - hierarchies vs. circles, etc - so must be excused for not incorporating these concepts. Nevertheless, his other ideas, drawn from the ancient sources, are remarkable and extremely insightful.

    Troubles and uncertainties are normal during a period of transition. Sunrise is always preceded by an increase in night's chill.

    Today man feels acutely the opposition between the tremendous technical progress and the obvious moral deficiency of humanity. In fact, while life on the material plane is moving at an accelerated pace due to the political, social and industrial Revolution, man has made no marked progress on the moral plane.

    Today, any being who thinks will feel unhappy; if his ability to do is deficient, his overdeveloped sensibility makes his active will all the more exacting and refined. This is so much so, that he sees his good intentions wither before they have had the strength to blossom.

    There is no reason to hope that the present situation will correct itself automatically. On the contrary, the more technical progress accelerates, the wider grows the gulf in modern man between wanting and the ability to do. This contradiction can be seen on every plane. For example, [over fifty years after] the end of the second world war, the world is trapped in a situation which is neither war nor peace. This in itself is an eloquent demonstration of the powerlessness of those in authority.

    ...Man must now discover new sources of moral energy in the same way that he has - thanks to science - found new sources of physical energy.

    [The solution lies in a network of human beings] whose latent moral faculties are developed and cultivated.

    The knowledge and understanding and savior-faire needed to attain this aim have been preserved through the centuries...

    In their ensemble, they form the WAY.

    This is "esoteric Christianity."

    Century after century, while the flame of primitive Christianity burned low, esoteric work has remained vigilant. The esoteric meaning of the work was a preparatory effort: its objective was to accumulate the necessary energies on the astral plane, and so make it easier for humanity to pass through the great turnings of History...

    These changes in direction, and the coming of the new era they imply, have been constantly notable for the varied active and eminent roles played by women....

    The principle of Woman's intervention is found in ALL crucial periods of history.

    Periods where the ennobling role of the woman in the life of human society has faded are marked by a triviality of morals and manners, expressed in particular by a taste for realism carried to its utmost limits.

    Today, human relations suffer from a real distortion in the innate role that woman is destined to play at the side of man: instead of being the active force in these relations, the inspiring and fruitful complement to the man, the woman tends to follow a parallel path, which no longer permits her to exercise her own creative vocation.

    [...] Man and woman once formed a single spiritual being - [even if in separate bodies] - endowed with the unique consciousness of the real Self; The Being described in the myth of the Androgyne.

In the cycle of the "Fall," the male dominator conceptualization, the rule of the Father and the son, human beings became isolated from their real "I." Human beings take the illusions of the "I," the "predator's mind, so to say, as reality.

    The incomplete "I" of the Personality, unfinished and powerless, wanders in life with no faith and no true affection. It goes from error to error, from weakness to weakness, and from lie to lie. A prisoner - perhaps voluntarily - but nevertheless a prisoner - man does not do what he wants to do in life, but does what he hates, blindly obeying a diabolical mechanicalness which, under its three aspects: fear, hunger and sexuality, rules his life.

    This purely factitious existence has nothing real except the possibility of evolution - which remains latent, and forms the objective of esoteric studies and work. Apart from this seed, everything in exterior life is based on lies.

    If the Fall is a direct consequence of identifying with the "I" of personality [the predator's mind, the degraded DNA state], and the solitude of polar beings separated by the Fall is the source of weakness in humans who have in this way become mortal, the return of Unity appears to be an inexhaustible source of new energies. These energies are necessary to man, and to restore the dangerously disturbed equilibrium of today's public and private life, he must seek them out.

    However, this return to the perfect unity of polar beings is not give freely. It is the exclusive privilege of those who have crossed, or are ready to cross, the Second Threshold of the Way.

    It is through realization of the totally indivisible unity of their real "I", by two polar Individualities arrived at the Second Birth, that the original sin can and must be redeemed.

    This is the solution to the problem - the need to find a new source of moral energy. We have reached this solution by means of the positive method of esoteric study.

    Man must link together the work of the intellectual and emotional centers.

    If the question to be studied and solved is of an intellectual nature, then, after the intellectual center has elucidated it, before reaching a conclusion or final decision and before taking action, man must consult his emotional center. Conversely, he must not act impulsively or exclusively under the influence of the emotional center: before acting, he must consult his intellectual center.

    In general, man must cultivate in himself the ability to grasp any phenomenon and any problem - in the inner and outer worlds - by simultaneously using the two centers - emotional and intellectual.

    ***

    The natural growth of the Personality stops long before it is complete. It has an individual limit which depends upon a whole ensemble of factors including: civilization, race, caste, family and social surroundings, education and instruction.

    Without continuous conscious effort, the development of the Personality beyond this limit can never occur. ...To take development further, conscious efforts must be made. The rule is exact: whoever does not develop his talents loses them.

    We generally seek to develop these talents through education. As long as our studies or researches continue, the Personality continues to grow, although often in a not very harmonious way. But when studies and researches end, and we start to exploit the knowledge we have acquired in this routine manner, the development of the Personality ceases.

    The most important and most difficult stage of the Way to pass is the Staircase, also called the path of Access, which leads to the level of man # 4 [the master of the coach.]

    Anyone who seeks to climb this must make this effort the principal aim of his life. From now on, esoteric work must become the axis of his existence, round which the inner and outer circumstances of his life revolve.

    This categorical demand must not frighten us. At the same time, we must realize that the tests begin from the first step of the Staircase.

    To cross the first Threshold, many must undergo the first test successfully without looking back: he must be ablaze with the ardent desire to overcome the entanglement of life in the wilderness, so that he can throw himself into the unknown in a search for a new, reasonable and real life.


On 02-12-97, Ark attended his first session with the C's and the following exchange occurred:

    Q: (A) My first question is: I want to understand what is this "predestined mission," what it consists of?
    A: It consists of following the path that has confronted you.
    Q: (A) Okay...
    A: We do not tell you of your predestined mission, because then it is no longer "predestined." You learn by experience, and as you sense, you are on the threshold of a rather profound experience. [...] We were always most impressed with his skills in this area. Do you remember being caught in a cold rain on the "long walk," and how through your upset, you had an insight that "opened a new door?" We remember 1966 as a turning point. Well, this is another, Arkadiusz, and the emotions feel strangely familiar, but this time you have the aid of others on 3rd density. [...] Before, when fear crept into the picture, you had the wisdom not to "look back," even though you had the temptation to do this. Look what has happened!

    Mouravieff writes: If the desire for transformation has enough vigor and intensity, this will fill the interval between the notes DO and Si, which is the First Threshold - the seeker will then stand with a firm footing on the first step of the Staircase.

The idea of a staircase has been mentioned numerous times by the C's, most notably in the context of my then future relations with Ark:

    Q: (L) Is Ark going to be able to help us with technology, to help other people, or to protect ourselves in some way? In this really bizarre stuff going on on our planet?
    A: Too much, too soon, my dear. Curiosity killed the cat.
    Q: (L) Well, satisfaction brought him back!
    A: Not in this case!!!
    Q: (T) You've got to let this go along. It's picking up momentum every day, it seems. So, just let it roll along and let it see where it goes. (L) All right, lets... (T) He's coming to protect you. That's what he said.
    A: Maybe, but there is so, so, so much more in store than that!!!!!!
    Q: (L) Stop!... Is that an ominous, 'maybe, but there's so, so, so much more in store?' Or is that a positive, there is so, so, so much more in store?
    A: Why would you think it ominous?
    Q: (L) Well I don't know.. because I'm scared of what I don't know! (T) Faith, we're back to faith again.
    A: What have we helped you to discover so far? Would you rather discontinue this operation?
    Q: (L) Oh, hell no! (T) After two years, you know she's always going to ask those kinds of questions!
    A: Not two years, eternity.
    Q: (L) Did I just get zinged? (T) No. No. Mirth! (J) Yes, we haven't had mirth in a while! (T) Just a little mirth there!
    A: We have helped you build your staircase one step at a time. Because you asked for it. And you asked for it because it was your destiny. We have put you in contact with those of rare ability in order for you to be able to communicate with us. Again, because you desired it, in order to realize your path. By now, you should recognize the signs... Those who display thinking patterns which in many ways deviate from that which is considered ordinary. The more unusual, the more telling. They have past lives on 3rd density earth, but not recently, but for this one. And they are not oriented to the earth frequency vibrations. [Group discussion ensued on the last response]
    Q: (T) ...It is destiny for you to find out what your path was, you had to make this contact, because it was what you were supposed to do. (L) Are we not talking about Freddie in terms of being put in contact with someone who enables me to communicate with you, so you can put me on my path, which is building the staircase, etc, etc. ? Is that not what we've got going here?
    A: He is one, but not the only one, just the one who awakened your sense of recognition.
    Q: (L) I know this is probably not the time to ask this question; this is the kind of discover, open find out, open that kind of thing, but it seems to me almost that you are leading up to say something, so maybe I can help you along by asking, what is this staircase, what is this destiny?
    A: Discover.

    Mouravieff: The four notes which form the Staircase are linked by a deep interdependence, since their resonance draws its strength from the initial impulse of Desire. This means that if this initial desire does not unite all man's existence in obedience [to the thing desired, i.e. to become free] if it does not dominate his whole being, it is better for him to stop in time and not cross the Threshold.

    We repeat: The Way is a path of no return. This is the real reason for this test of Desire. This Desire must have the strength of Thirst.

But it must be made clear that what Mouravieff means by "desire" is not what is normally meant.

    Cassiopaeans:
    A: "Passion" [in the physical sense] does not set one "free," quite the opposite!
    Q: (L) But what if your passion is for knowledge?
    A: That is not passion, it is soul questing.
    Q: (L) What is it that gives some people this drive, this steamroller effect that they are determined to get to the absolute bottom of everything and strip away every lie until there is nothing left but the naked truth? What is the source of this desire?
    A: Wrong concept. It is simply that one is at that point on the learning cycle. At that point, no drive is needed.
    Q: (L) So, you more or less are there because some critical mass has been reached that 'jumps' you to the point where seeking truth is simply who you are? It defines the parameters of your being.

    Mouravieff: The first step leads to the test of Faith. To Believe is not enough; one must have faith. Here we not that we are not talking about faith or belief in some outside source, but in the self. Here the seeker must surmount his fear of abandonment. Many trials and troubles will face the seeker... all designed to destroy his faith in his own ability to be and to succeed in finding the life that is not materially evident but is only a dream...

        Be not therefore anxious saying, what shall we eat? Or What shall we drink? or Wherewithal shall we be clothed? Your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. but seek ye first the Kingdom of God and His truth; and all these things shall be added unto you.

    The second step is a test of Strength.

    The third step is the test of Discernment and Skill. He who can see and understand the precept "you cannot serve God and Mammon" will be better prepared to withstand this test.

    The fourth step is the test of Love, or true, life-giving love, a consuming fire quite different from what now smolders under the ashes. It is a blazing sword whose flames burn up all alloy mixtures; all that man takes for love - within him or towards him - when it is not that. If we keep these words before our minds, we will immediately be able to judge every movement of the heart, and will know whether or not it contains traces of true Love.

    ***

    To live in the True, with all lies excluded, is the prerogative of the Cycle of the Spirit: Light without shadow.

    We speak here about certain human beings who have attained or who are about to attain the Second Birth. The text leaves no room for ambiguity:

        Lie not to one another: seeing that you have put off the old man with his doings and have put on the new man, that is being renewed until the knowledge after the image of God: where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave and freeman; but Christ is all and in all.

    This is only addressed to those who are on the Way in their relations between themselves.

    He who reaches Love would not know how to lie. But to triumph over lies requires an esoteric culture which is inaccessible to ordinary man.

    This highlights the important problem of lying.

    The struggle against lying is long and drawn out. It is first of all a struggle against ourselves, against our spontaneous tendencies, and against that mechanicalness that makes us revert constantly to lying.

    Useless lies to others are far less harmful than lying to oneself - and easier to master and heal. Lying to oneself sometimes takes on finely shaded forms that necessitate total and sustained attention, together with methodical and persistent efforts.

    to eliminate useless lying to others does not demand continual effort: one must simply watch to see that it does not slip into conversation. At the moment when it is on our lips a simple effort of attention is sufficient to stop it. That is why in struggling for truth, it is recommended to begin with this type of lie.

    But, we easily understand that lying to oneself, or the struggle against this kind of lie, is not perceptible from the exterior.

    When we stop lying uselessly, this will also be unnoticed by those around us. One can say that in practice, the struggle against these two categories of lies does not alter man's relations with other men in any way, although it is very effective for the person who undertakes it. We can therefore begin it without delay, as long as we do it discreetly so as not to draw attention to ourselves, and so do not provoke increasing pressure from the General Law [of accident and mechanicalness which will try to circumvent these efforts; i.e. The Predator's mind/Matrix.]

    [...] As for efforts at suppressing lies to oneself, they entail quite different and important consequences. Such lies grow deep roots. In this domain, paradoxical situations sometimes arise, some of them of such psychological subtlety that it is difficult to draw them out of the shade.

    Here we must mention the question of marriages where one of the partners, having realized that this union is an error, persists in trying to convince him or herself of the contrary. If he is of an affectionate nature, he will redouble his amiability towards his partner as if truly toward his polar "other." The absurdity of the situation reaches its limits if the other partner reacts by adopting a corresponding attitude - without any sincere or spontaneous glow of tenderness.

    The danger from the esoteric point of view is that, by mere force of habit, such a situation takes on for one of the partners, or even for both of them, the value of true love. this kind of lying to oneself can go on for dozens of years with people who are amiable and of good faith, and they entail tragic disillusions in the end.

    The man who starts to struggle against lying to himself must be forewarned of these difficulties, and of the possible collapse of some or all his greatest values.

    All should know that true esoteric work only begins after the individual has passed through a general bankruptcy and has had his gods helplessly thrown to the ground.

    We have indicated the absolute necessity for anyone who aspires to esoteric development to cure himself as soon as possible of this deep-rooted habit of lying to himself.

    We shall now look at this problem from another angle: that of the objective results which man obtains when he is able to stop lying.

    This work takes time, demands the courage to face disillusion, and needs self-confidence and faith in the self. As the seeker advances, he feels a new sentiment.

    He will sometimes feel bitter regret as his beautiful dreams vanish, but at the same time he will feel himself more and more liberated.

    His growing sincerity towards himself will establish an atmosphere of truth in his inner life. The law proclaimed "you shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free" will apply to him in its fullness.

    The word "free" was deliberately chosen to contrast a state of slavery.

    After each operation of inner purification, painful though it may be, the seeker will feel more and more fully a profound gratitude for being freed from this absurd slavery.

    Having reached a certain stage in internal liberation, the individual will understand the full value of the magical power expressed in the word Freedom.

    The acquisition of Inner Freedom is the sine qua non condition of further success in esoteric work.

    This elimination of lying to the self enables one to observe the work of the lower centers in the self objectively. This observation is commenced from this "command post" of impartial observation and judgment of the individual who has overcome the lies to the self.

    When our interior world is thus purified by these rays of the "B", when we have ceased to lie to ourselves, how then are we to act towards others?

    This problem is far from easy.

    It is written: "the kingdom of heaven is forced, and it is the violent men who hold it."

    If we remember that the kingdom of heaven is within, and NOT outside us, then we begin to understand that some force or even violence must be employed INTERNALLY to retake our own fortress.

    This is very often necessary to eliminate the roots of Illusion within us, the mother of lies to ourselves.

    Thus we see that the test at the fourth step is decisive. Until lying stops, man drags along the defects of his past: lying, weakness, self-pity, inner compromise.

    Generally, it takes time, the opportunity and the possibility to rid himself of his baggage before committing himself to the fourth step is met. Many individuals, because of the weight of their past, waste time and allow many opportunities which present themselves to go by.

    But, on the fourth step, the balance sheet must be drawn up and accounts settled. Man, poor and naked, is accepted at the second Threshold, but only on condition that he is consistent and pure.

    The essential is that he be consistent, meaning that he contains within himself true Love, which can only be revealed by the cessation of lying to the self.

    Everything false within him will be burned by the flames of this blazing sword.

    All of these steps happen more or less together in many combinations. They are distributed unequally according to different personalities, and driven by the force of our Desire to be free.

    In stepping onto the Staircase, to approach and then cross the Second Threshold, man adopts a new attitude towards himself: from this point on, he takes his fate in his own hands.

    During later development, the Individuality becomes progressively integrated with the higher cosmos.

    Cassiopaeans:
    Q: (L) Let me ask this one before the tape runs out and we take a break. What is the "ultimate secret" being protected by the Consortium?
    A: You are not in control of yourselves, you are an experiment. [...]
    Q: (L) Yes. Okay. How "long", and I put long in quotes, because we know, as you say, there is no time, but how long, as we measure it, have the Grays been interacting with our race? The Grays, not the Lizards, the Grays, the cybergenetic probes?
    A: No.
    Q: (L) What do you mean, "No"?
    A: Time travelers, therefore, "Time is ongoing."
    Q: (L) Okay, recently I read a couple of books Jan gave me, "Knight in Shining Armor" and "Replay". Both of these books described time travel.
    A: No, not finished with answer. Do you understand the gravity of last response?
    Q: (L) They are time travelers, they can move forward and backward in time, they can play games with our heads... (T) They can set up the past to create a future they want. (D) They can organize things so that they can create the energy that they need... (L) They can also make things look good, make them feel good, make them seem good, they can make you have an idea one minute, and then the next minute, create some sort of situation that confirms that idea...
    A: When you asked how long, of course it is totally unlimited, is it not?
    Q: (L) That's not good. If they were to move back through space time and alter an event in our past, would that alteration in the past instantaneously alter our present as well?
    A: Has over and over and over.
    Q: (D) So they do it over and over and over, constantly? (L) So, at each...
    A: You just are not yet aware, and have no idea of the ramifications!!!
    Q: (L) We're getting a little glimmer! Yeah, I do, a little! (T) The ramifications of being able to move in and out of time and manipulate it the way you want (Jan/Laura) And the ramifications of what they're doing to us; what they are doing to us and what they will do to us, over and over. (Freddy) What did it say about over and over? (L) So, in other words, our only real prayer in this whole damn situation is to get out of this density level. That's what they're saying, that's what it sounds like to me.
    A: Close.
    Q: (L) Because, otherwise, we're just literally, as in that book, stuck in the replay over and over and over, and the Holocaust could happen over and over, and we could just, you know... Genghis Khan, Attila the Hun... over and over and over again. (T) We're stuck in a time loop; they're putting us in a time loop. (J) Are we in a time loop?
    A: Yes.
    Q: (D) I have a question about... there was a... (PAUSE) Mankind has found it necessary for some reason or other to appoint time for some reason or other. The only reason I can see is to have a means of telling, like in verbal or written communications...
    A: Control mechanism.
    Q: (T) Is there a way for us to break the control mechanism? Besides moving to 4th density? (D) That was part...
    A: Nope.
    Q: (D) When 4th density beings communicate it's telepathic, right?
    A: Yes.
    Q: (D) Okay, since time doesn't exist, how do you communicate about happenings?
    A: Rephrase, please; clarify.
    Q: (L) What she means to ask is, if you're communicating telepathically... (D) On 4th density.. (L) And time doesn't exist, how do you communicate about events as one happens now, as opposed to later and the next thing happens, and the next thing happens... (J) How is it sequential?
    A: Translate.
    Q: (D) Translate? Okay, let me explain what I mean. I mean, we talk about 1907 something happened...
    A: That is how it is done.
    Q: (T) Translate is how it is done. You translate the experience?
    A: From 4 to 3. And vice versa.
    Q: (L) So, in other words, it's almost like making movies. (J) Are linear thought processes part of it? Is it being linear and non-linear?
    A: Part of 3d illusion only.
    Q: (L) So, in other words, if you're a 4th density being, everything is more or less happening, excuse the term happening, everything is simultaneous, and if you wish to discuss or communicate or have any focus upon any particular aspect of this unified dimension, then what you do is you kind of extract it out, project it into 3d...
    A: Close.
    Q: (L) ... like a movie.
    A: But you will not understand fully until you get there

    Mouravieff: The life of man is a film. It is certainly difficult for our Cartesian minds to grasp this concept. Our three-dimensional minds are badly adapted to ideas and facts which touch on the domain of the eternal.

    Incomprehensible as it may seem, our life is truly a film produced in accordance with a script. This film goes on continuously, without ever stopping, in such a way that, at the time of his death, man is born again. What seems absurd is that he is born in the same place, at the same date where he was born before, and of the same parents. So the film goes on again. Each human being, then, is born with his own particular film. this represents the field of action in which man is called to apply his conscious efforts.

    The repetition of the film is not reincarnation, although these two notions are often confused. Exterior man, who lives in the system of the Future-Past cannot embrace in a single moment the ensemble of his film, nor even the part that contains his immediate future. To do so, he would need to enlarge the slot of his Present.

    It thus happens to him that, faced with certain events, he will feel that he has already seen or lived those events. Some see in such phenomena the proof of so called reincarnation. In reality, phenomena of this sort are the result of a casual and temporary surge of fine energies in the organism: the slot of the individual Present then enlarges for a few moment, and some significant facts of the immediate future slip into the waking consciousness. In this way, the impression is created of a return of another time. In a certain way this is true, although the impression of having lived before is only caused by mechanical unfolding of the film.

    By reincarnation, we must understand a phenomenon of a very different order. Although the theoretical film revolves integrally on the plane of possibilities, meaning in eternity, the film of the exterior man clings to the plane of realization, that is, of Time, but only to the extent strictly necessary to satisfy the ends of the Ray of Creation.

    True reincarnation, on the other hand, occurs entirely in time, and belongs integrally to the domain of the Real, well understood as part of the broader frame of Manifestation. The human personality is not a reality in the proper sense of the word, but a possibility. It plays a role in the film to which it is attached, from which it will not disappear until the moment of the Second Birth. At that moment, it will cease to be a Personality. Because of its indestructible union with the real "I", it will be transfigured, and so it will become an Individuality. As long as man lives in the wilderness, self-satisfied and immersed in lies and illusions, the film will unfold with mechanical inflexibility, and the Personality will remain entirely unchanged.

    These circumstances start to change the moment man crossed the first Threshold. This passage can be compared to the conception of the future Individuality. The Staircase symbolizes the period of gestation, and the crossing of the second Threshold represents the second Birth, the birth of Individuality. As man becomes more and more integrated with his "I", growing his Individuality, he becomes progressively integrated with the Cosmos and acquires "gifts" appropriate to his individual nature. Simultaneously, he progressively participates in real, objective existence, which finally characterizes his being.

    This is liberation from the bonds of the film.

    It is only at this point of evolution that true individual reincarnation becomes possible.

    True reincarnation is not mechanical; it is done consciously, generally to accomplish a mission.

    Cassiopaeans:
    Q: (LC) Well, if that's the case! I want to ask about past life relations between us. I'm sure there is.
    A: Be specific.
    Q: (LC) Are there any specific past life connections between any of the women in this room?
    A: Who?
    Q: (LC) Well, let's start with Laura. Do I have a past life connection with Laura?
    A: Before we answer that, we wish to hear from you what you perceive a past life circumstance to be.
    [..] How do you perceive the reincarnation process to be?
    Q: (LC) I perceive it as you come back with people you choose to come back with, and that you choose people that you are karmically connected to. (I) I see it a little bit differently than that...
    A: Aha! We have a variance!
    Q: (I) I think that when we die and go to 5th density, that we make pacts with people in each incarnation, so when you come back, it is coming back to fulfill that pact. (LC) Yes, that is the way my line of thinking is going. But, when they asked that question, I was thinking that you have people you come back with because of closeness. Somebody may be your mother in one life, and there is a love bond, and then there are other people that you come back with because you have to resolve something to let go of that person rather than to get closer.
    A: This is partially correct. But, there is more to it than this. For example, one can incarnate on various planes of existence, not just the one you perceive currently. And, one may actually reincarnate on more than one plane concurrently, if one is advanced enough to do this.
    Q: (L) Are you suggesting that ...
    A: Yes, we are!
    Q: (L) I was thinking it, but they didn't let me finish. For the record, I was thinking that we are all part of the same soul unit here.
    A: To an extent, but you may not yet understand what exactly a "soul unit" is in that sense. And of course, there is more than one sense for this as well. The "trick" that 3rd density STS life forms will learn, either prior to transition to 4th density, or at the exact juncture, is to think in absolutely limitless terms. The first and most solid step in this process is to not anticipate at all. This is most difficult for you. We understand this, but this as also why we keep reiterating this point. For example, imagine if one of your past lives is also a future life? [...]
    Q: (P) Now, I just want to say that I think that we have all of us here traveled back in time to change the way things are now. We inserted ourselves into this time period to wake up and see what is really happening. This is 3rd density thinking, I know, but it is the only way I can describe it. We looked back on the way things happened, the way the world is now, and we have come back to change things. We have come from the future, to wake up now, because we didn't wake up before. (C) Maybe that's our "past life/future life" connection here? (P) Right, we all agreed to insert ourselves in this time line.... (L) So, we ARE from the future... (P) Because the world is going in this direction, and SOMETHING had to be done. That's what I see. (I) Yes. We all decided to come back, but there was a strong possibility that we would not be able to wake up and link up. And that's why so many things happened to attempt to keep us from getting together. (P) Not just that, things happen to keep us from waking up period! We've all been bombarded with stuff all our lives. (I) Yes, and when we started waking up, and realized that we HAD to come together to "link" to DO whatever it is we are going to do, there has to be all kinds of things to prevent it even! [Laughter] (S) I would like to ask a question about synchronicity...
    A: Wait a minute... someone said something a short while ago that is surprisingly close to the truth. Now just a moment... reflect please.
    Q: (L) P*** was saying that we have come back from the future and inserted ourselves into this timeline...
    A: Yes. That is close to being totally correct!
    Q: (L) In terms of reincarnation, that we were talking about a few minutes before that, we are possibly incarnations of ourselves incarnated at different levels. This just happens to be one of the levels of reality that we are occupying, but there are other selves at other levels thinking and doing other level stuff, and these other levels are perceived by us as the future...
    A: Maybe for some of you, but let us not get ahead of ourselves.
    Q: (P) The C's say that they are US in the future. So, we, being THEM in the future, some of who they are in the future, have come back as us, to do what we are doing, to undo what is happening on Earth...
    A: Close, but more complex than that. It would be difficult for you to completely understand at this point, but let us just say that you are close.

    Mouravieff: It is important to grasp clearly the difference which exists between the film, a mixture of possibilities, and reincarnation in time, which belongs to the domain of the Real, and to understand the meaning of this difference.

    At the time of the second Birth, that is to say, by crossing the Second Threshold, man escapes his bondage to the film, and enters the domain of redemption. He is then admitted into the sacred brotherhood of living Beings. These beings are an unshakable force: those who are part of it are no longer subject to illness or sorrow. Death loses its hold over them. They have overcome the world.

    In theory, the film in which man is born and in which he lives can go on until the end of the world, on condition that he is happy, satisfied with himself, attributing his virtues to himself, and blaming others for his mistakes and misfortunes. Properly speaking, this kind of existence cannot be considered as human; it could be described as anthropoid. This term is justified in the sense that exterior man, immersed in self-satisfaction, represents the crowning achievement of millions of years of evolution of the species from its animal ancestors, yet from the point of view of esoteric evolution, he is a possibility which has not yet been realized.

    If we envisage the problem of esoteric evolution from the point of view of the film and the different parts man can play in it, it is clear that this kind of evolution is impossible as long as the film can always be considered as turning in the same circle. People who perform in such a film are those we have called anthropoids, puppets, the dead who, in the words of Jesus, "believe themselves to be alive."

    Esoteric evolution starts when man, by his conscious efforts, proves capable of breaking the circle and transforming it into an ascending spiral. The spiral represents an intermediate state between the position where the human Personality is found to be trapped in the film, which revolves mechanically in a way hardly separated from the eternal plane, and that of the perfect, free Individuality, who is able, if need arises, to reincarnate consciously in Time.

    This is an intermediate state in this sense, that the film definitely departs from the plane of the eternal, from the plane of possibilities. The curve of life, which for exterior man does not in practice differ from a circle, transforms itself into a spiral and does not end - as it did previously - almost at its point of departure: the distance between these two points now marks a definite progression in Time.

    The film in the form of a spiral belongs to human beings who climb the staircase. Complete disengagement of the film is produced at the moment of crossing the second threshold. If man is able to do that successfully during a single life, so breaking the circle for the very first time, he does not return to it. Such a case is very rare: it is the lot of the just.

    Generally, this liberation requires several lives; several revolutions of the spiral. As a general rule, each revolution occurs in Time, and consequently can appear to be a reincarnation. In reality, it is nothing but a return to exterior life. A pseudo-reincarnation like this is neither conscious nor personal: it is the actors in the film who return, and they do not remember any previous experiences.

    However, a change is possible as soon as the conscious efforts of man increase the effect of the Time factor by enlarging perception of the Present. In a film which unfolds in a spiral in this way, the contents of the play change; they change in two ways: first in each life, that is, during each revolution, and also from spiral to spiral. The composition of the cast, the circumstances, and the scenery all change. Two elements however remain permanent: first, the general aim, to reach and cross the second Threshold; then the absolute condition for crossing this Threshold, that all the karmic debts which have been accumulated in the present life, as well as during previous spirals, must be neutralized and liquidated.

    Before the Second Threshold, every drama must be played out to its denouement. The work is hard and difficult because man constantly makes mistakes.

    The attentive reader has already understood that following the spiral, or climbing the Staircase, is reserved for human beings who have already absorbed a certain quantity of "B" influences and who thus possess a more or less developed magnetic center. This does not guarantee that they will make no more errors.

    It is true that from the time man first mounts the Staircase he is watched, especially if he makes sincere and considerable efforts. The Esoteric Brotherhood offers him a helping hand. Certain meetings, a play of favorable circumstances, are the forms taken by this help. This assistance does not, however, free him of the need to work on himself and to go on making conscious efforts. In addition, it must be said that often the proffered help is not used, because man does not listen to the advice given, or because he does not grasp the meaning of the favorable circumstances and the possibilities of progress which open before him. He is still more than half a creature of the domain of Illusion, he continues to take frequent impulsive decisions, and often turns against his own avowed aims.

    It must be understood that as long as a man has not attained and crossed the Second Threshold, he will have to start all over again. He will restart every spiral in the wilderness, he will once again have to discern the Cosmic Solar influences, cross the First Threshold, and climb the Staircase step by step. It is true that no conscious effort is ever lost, but the experience acquired in one spiral only appears in the next in the form of innate personal aptitudes, or vague recollections of people in the cast.

    We should know that, at the end of a spiral (incarnation), a comparison is made between the film as it was conceived at the time of birth and what it has become at the time of death. The balance sheet between these two states is drawn up, as in accounting, by listing assets and liabilities, followed by a profit/loss statement. This will show the result of the elapsed life objectively.

    This balance sheet furnishes the basic elements for composing the film at the start of the following spiral.

    If we could avoid all errors and complications in this new experience, produced as a result of free movements, esoteric evolution would then occur in a harmonious rising curve.

    Generally, this is not the case. Man most often comes to this idea of evolution after he has already complicated the film to which he belongs.

    But true evolution cannot occur except on the basis of the original film - after all artificially added elements have been eliminated. The latter is conditional on a return to the PURITY of the centers, especially the emotional center which - at least at the start - is the sole receptacle of Cosmic Solar influences.

    Cassiopaeans:
    Q: (L) Are instincts different from emotions?
    A:Yes.
    Q: (L) How can you tell the difference between instinctive knowledge and emotional reactions?
    A: Emotions involve wishful thinking, instincts are "gut feelings," psychic in nature, and are stronger. When it is wishful thinking, there is always psychic instinct seeping through which you can access if you use reason and examine your lessons of the past.
    Q: (L) Is it also correct that emotion can be used to mislead, that is emotions that are twisted and generated strictly from the flesh or false programming?
    A: Emotion that limits is an impediment to progress. Emotion is also necessary to make progress in 3rd density. It is natural. When you begin to separate limiting emotions based on assumptions from emotions that open one to unlimited possibilities, that means you are preparing for the next density.
    Q: (L) What about Love?
    A: What about it?
    Q: (L) There are many teachings that are promulgated that Love is the key, the answer. They say that illumination and knowledge and what-not can all be achieved through love.
    A: The problem is not the term "love," the problem is the interpretation of the term. Those on third density have a tendency to confuse the issue horribly. After all, they confuse many things as love. When the actual definition of love as you know it is not correct either. It is not necessarily a feeling that one has that can also be interpreted as an emotion, but rather, as we have told you before, the essence of light which is knowledge is love, and this has been corrupted when it is said that love leads to illumination. Love is Light is Knowledge. Love makes no sense when common definitions are used as they are in your environment. To love you must know. And to know is to have light. And to have light is to love. And to have knowledge is to love.

    Mouravieff:
    The heart must therefore be pure, and if not already pure, it must be purified. This is the sine qua non condition of success.

    All the discussion of lying in all its aspects is given to emphasize the absolute need for purifying the heart, and for beginning to re-educate the emotional center in a positive direction. [Remember, the emotions are represented by the horse pulling the coach.]

    This necessity explains the meaning of the words of Jesus: "Except you turn, and become as little children, you shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven."

    This refers specifically to the emotional life. Many have interpreted this as a restriction on the development of the intellect. This is a huge mistake. Intelligence and intellect must be developed and stimulated. The admonition to "become as little children" only points to the need for purity of the centers, NOT the idea of keeping them in a primitive state.

    Paul wrote: Brothers, be not children in that which concerns judgment, be children in what concerns malice, but as to judgment, be fully grown men."

    ***

    It is now time to turn to a possible short cut in esoteric work which can rapidly take us to the second Threshold.

    This is a possibility offered to Polar beings, those couples described by the ancient Tradition in the myth of the Androgyne.

    On the basis of the preceding analysis, the essential data for the film of any ordinary person can be described as follows: as the hero of the romance of his own life, the subject must necessarily be the star of the film.

    But he can also play a minor role in the film of people who play a secondary role in his own film. In this way, each film gets enmeshed with other films, where the same people are found in totally different situations.

    One must also distinguish between two categories of actors.

    The first are really part of the cast. A definite role is assigned to them: they are organically tied to the film.

    The second group only appear by accident in the film, drawn into the action by the free movements of the hero. This complexity is further increased because some of the actors who have genuine parts in the film play their roles badly, while others play roles which are not their own. Situations like this are widespread.

    The human Personality is an organism with multiple parts or facets, 987 to be exact. In the ideal case, only realized by polar beings, and the only effective one from the esoteric point of view, the 987 facets of man and woman are strictly polar. These are the predestined husband and wife whose union will create a true couple.

    However, the cast contains other people, who play roles organically tied to that of the hero, and who are necessary to bring the film in its ensemble to its natural end. these are friend souls, brother souls, sister souls, collaborating souls, servant souls, etc. The Personalities of each of them have a certain number of facts identical to those of the hero, for actors of the same sex, or polar for actors of the opposite sex. In the case of brothers and sisters, the number of identical or polar facets can be as many as half or even more.

    The lack of discernment and of sincerity towards ourselves, the innate desire to find a perfect resonance to the vibration of our soul, and the impatience that follows, all multiplied by the action of the General Law [of accident], induce us too often to contract unions which can only result in absurd situations. Instead of resisting the mirage; instead of waiting and seeking, we slip into imperfect unions, which are a source of suffering both for the partners and their children. In addition, these unions alter the meaning of the film in its ensemble, and so corrupt the personal lives of all the actors in the drama. Lastly, the esoteric results foreseen in the initial composition of the film are gravely compromised.

    It is as a result of considering on the matrimonial plane, or through lack of consideration on the sexual plane, that most of our errors are committed, including those which demand the heaviest payment.

    Even beings of good faith are not exempt from error.

    To confuse a brother or sister soul for husband or wife compounds very complicated situations, especially from the esoteric point of view. The situation is all the more confused when children are born from such unions.

    Life then takes on the character of a perpetual compromise with oneself. the moral and physical health of "accidentally united couples" suffers: with changes in the intellectual center due to cheating and lying; heart disease if the emotional center is sensitive and still aspires to the truth; also diseases of obscure origin, of which cancer is one that attacks the body in its most fragile parts. In every case, the condition necessarily leads to permanent loss of fine energies which, in its turn, brings on accelerated aging and leads to premature death.

    Difficult as are these situations that arise out of our errors, they must not prevent anyone who throws himself into esoteric work from finding the courage in himself to look them in the face and to search for a satisfactory outcome. If the Devil - the General Law - tries to lead us into new errors to obstruct our esoteric evolution, the supporting hand of the Lord is always stretched out to help us. Yet our minds, too rational and too realistic, often stop us from sensing this help.

    When a situation has been entangled by our errors, the Gordian knot must NOT be cut, it must be untied in such a way that the participants, both tied by the same knot, feel only relief at the disappearance of a situation which was simply a source of suffering for both.

    If the situation is resolved, the original meaning of the film and its normal development can be found.

    The ensemble of people organically linked in one film forms a team. In the initial conception of the film, this team must attain a predetermined aim as a result of the way the participants play their roles in the play of life. This esoteric aim is always different from the aims we follow under the influences of the General Law [the Matrix]

    The objective for such a team always has an esoteric meaning in fact, though the Personalities which compose it may be very different. they will share a deep need: a desire to end lies and illusions once and for all, the escape the domination of the [Predator's mind] and, in one form or another, to reach that objective existence in which man finds his real "I" and identifies himself with it.

    Here we must describe the principal law which underlies the formation of these teams. On the material plane, the greatest reward goes to him who commands. On the esoteric plane, the greatest reward goes to him who serves.

    The confusion between these two important master ideas - that of commanding and of serving - sometimes appears dramatic. Even among Jesus' disciples, the question of knowing who was greatest among them tormented them.

    The more evolved the team, the more important the task entrusted to it. History provides examples of the work of teams in all fields. the role of women in teams is particularly marked in crucial periods of the history of peoples.

    [...]Once the First Threshold is crossed, esoteric work will begin to reveal the true meaning of the film. Man must proceed with an impartial analysis of its contents: the role that each of the actors plays in it - and the value of this role - must be passed through a sieve.

    Gradually, as this stripping work progresses, the positive or negative character of different roles emerges more and more clearly. After this, inappropriate elements tend to disappear from the scene.

    At the end of this analysis, the film will contain only a reduced number of actors. but all of them are organically bound together, and with the hero, by the contents of the play, as it was conceived from the beginning of these experiences... which are pursued by the real "I" through centuries or even millennia. The play must then be played out to its resolution or denouement.

    The basic task of man, once he has crossed the first Threshold, is to shelter himself from the karmic influences which are the effects of errors committed in his free movements, either in the present life or in the past. In the past, workers used to go to some monastery or hermitage where they were able to concentrate on introspective work. In the present, our times require energetic and rapid methods.

    Our last question is to examine the method whereby the Staircase between the two Thresholds can be climbed more quickly, while we remain and work in the contemporary world.

    This means exists: it is to work as a couple. However, for this esoteric work to be completed successfully by two people, it is essential that the two beings - man and woman - are integrally polar.

    Cassiopaeans:
    Q: (L) Let me ask a question. Earlier they said something about being on the threshold of an experience. And now they say something is going to unfold in front of you. Are the two response "threshold" and "unfold in front of you," connected?
    A: Of course!!!
    Q: (L) Okay, he is on the threshold of some kind of experience. Is there some way that we might identify this experience? Is it going to be so outstanding that you can't miss it? Or, is it going to be something that you have to pay attention to or you might miss it?
    A: What does "threshold" imply?
    Q: (L) Well, a door. It's a door. Does this mean he is going to go through a door, psychically, spiritually, physically? Going to someone's house?
    A: It does not just imply a "door," but also one's positioning, and a sense of inevitability.
    Q: (L) Is there something I can do to help?
    A: Have you not helped already?
    Q: (L) But, I mean specifically in this "threshold" and "unfolding" experience?
    A: Yes! And, by the way, Arkadiusz, science is most spiritual indeed!
    Q: (L) Well, considering certain other elements, I was just wondering if our pathways are supposed to now be parallel or diverge... how they relate from this point...
    A: Seems to us that your pathways are intertwining!
    Q: (L) The use of the word "intertwining" is curious. You used that in regard to the relationship between EM and gravity. Is there a parallel?
    A: If you wish. [...]
    Q: (L) One last question: you say "combine energies." Is there any reason why this will facilitate the pursuit of answers?
    A: Complementary souls.

    Mouravieff:
    In the "long path," by successive elimination based on long and minute analysis of his film, and after new errors and new failures, man may end by finding his legitimate spouse, a fully integral polar being with whom to unite himself.

    In the "short path", man must begin by a conscious search for his polar being. If found, they can work together on the film which - in its origin - is common to them both.

    A man alone is incomplete. But just where he is weak, his polar being is strong. together, they form an integral being: their union leads to the fusion of their Personalities and a faster crystallization of their complete subtle bodies, united into a common second Birth.

    This is the redemption of "original sin."

    The system of films is conceived in such a way that polar beings will necessarily meet in life, in certain cases more than once. Only the confused ties contracted in this life by each of them, as a result of their free movements, combined with the karmic consequences of one or more previous experiences, can divert the man or woman from the ONLY being with whom they could from a Micro cosmos.

    If there were no karmic debt, everything would go wonderfully: two young people would meet in the most favorable family and social atmosphere, and their union would represent a true fairy-tale. But this is not reality.

    Obeying the principle of Imperfection, and moved by the action of the General Law, the two predestined beings will commit errors. Deeply buried in lies, they do not generally know how to appreciate the gift they are given. Often, they do not even recognize each other.

    If this is the case, then an agonizing question is put: is there one or more means to detect our polar being, and if so, what are these means?

    To meet that person, to do so without recognition, to let our polar being pass by, is the worst mistake we could possibly make: because we would remain in our factitious life, without light.

    Must not everything be sacrificed in favor of a union which is the only chance of our life: the promise of return to paradise lost?

    Nevertheless we should beware of the last trap, one we can fall into just at the moment when ineffable happiness seems to smile upon us.

    We have just said: all must be sacrifices; we have not said: all must be broken.

    If, having recognized one another, the two polar beings triumph over this last ordeal or test, often the most painful, the new life, will open in front of them, as they are then called to be One on earth and in heaven.

    But let us now return to the question of knowing how not to pass by after having met our true alter ago, the pledge of happiness and salvation.

    There is a whole series of subjective and objective clues which assist us in recognizing our polar being. The polarization is manifested on ALL planes simultaneously: sexual, physical, mental and spiritual.

    Two elements must be taken into consideration: If it is correct to say that the predestined man and woman are absolutely polar beings, this polarity is not simple because, to a certain measure, both are physically, mentally and spiritually hermaphroditic beings. That measure, that proportion, is at the same time, sufficient and necessary. It is necessary to permit every being coming into this world to carry within himself the image of the polar being; this image is expressed, in each case, by means of the organ of the opposite sex which exists in every being in a state of non-development. It is, so to say, a part of the flesh and blood of his polar being that each one of us carries within himself. this proportion is sufficient, that is, it is the absolute minimum that will not jeopardize the complete polarity, since the proportion of hermaphroditism in both polar beings is strictly equivalent.

    The second element, which is subjective, is the distortion of our personality due to conscious or unconscious deviations to which the initial film was subject during the course of our existence. Distortions of this kind make it more difficult to recognize the polar being, and can make us less willing to exert ourselves to unite with that being.

    [...] It is the Androgyne who constitutes a true Micro cosmos, not the isolated man or woman. The creation of man in the image and likeness of god was in the form of the Androgyne: this description refers to the joint astral body of two polar beings.

    For man as for woman, salvation in the bosom of the Absolute depends on their reintegration in the Micro cosmos, as Paul indicates explicitly: "neither is the woman without the man, nor the man without the woman in the Lord."

    Man and woman are in fact, incomplete beings who - taken apart - cannot reflect in His fullness the image of God who is all in all.

    it is an axiom that every man and every woman has a polar being.

    Nevertheless, not all human beings feel the imperative need to be united to their polar being. Beings who live enclosed in their Personality without thinking deeply - which constitutes the great majority of humanity - enthusiastically involve themselves in a life ruled by material influences, and do not really feel the need for such a union. For them, the polar being is on the same plane as everyone else. The Personality does not perceive anything exceptional in him, and if by some chance an extraordinary impression is experienced, it is instead felt as something abnormal and embarrassing.

    We can speak of couples formed under the influence of the Law of Accident in which the partners have opposite aspirations. At the base of such unions we often find, beside a double error of judgment, the influences of karmic debt, remote or recent. the most intelligent attitude to take on such occasions is to unite the efforts of the couple to unravel the situation to their mutual benefit. Left to itself, the situation will only get worse.

    Very special care must be taken of the children of such a union, as they suffer within the union. Everything must be done to remedy this. As a general rule, we must not lose sight of the fact that, even if it is permitted to the human being to offer himself in sacrifice, he has no right to accept the sacrifice of others. To sacrifice yourself to a union that is formed under the law of accident only teaches your children to do likewise and hinders their possibilities of ever discovering their own polar being.

    Accelerated evolution of the hero of a film via work on the self - i.e. purification - brings him ever nearer to his polar being. At the same time, it automatically removes from the film those personalities who are not organically integral.

    After the formation of the magnetic center within him, man starts to feel the desire, the need, to be united to his polar being. This desire and need will increase in proportion to the growth of the latter.

    The concept of the Androgyne has purely mythical or theoretical value for ordinary man. But we now realize that a living aspiration to be re-integrated in the Micro cosmos - the most direct way to the re-integration in the Absolute - is the fruit of a high moral culture within the individual.

    As mentioned, esoteric evolution is conditioned at the start by bankruptcy, a moral breakdown. To make progress after this, man must know exactly where he stands. He must SEE himself.

    Isaac the Syrian said that he who has been able to see himself as he IS, is better than he who has seen angels.

    what we call bankruptcy, the ancient traditions call "death." It is death while still in a living body. One must first die, then be resurrected.

     By progressively taking his fate into his own hands, man at the same time takes responsibility for ALL the partners in his film.

    He must restore the original meaning of his film, then push the development of the latter in such a way that the "play" be properly played out to its intended denouement.

    The hero, while working on himself, must apply himself to create new circumstances around him, which will enhance the unfolding of the action towards its originally intended conclusion.

    His exterior efforts must above all be directed towards the creation of these circumstances, NOT towards seeking direct influence over people. Such direct influence over people may seem opportune, but it is an error. Instead of unraveling the situation, the influence creates karmic debts which complicate things all the more. One must be very prudent and circumspect.

    Yet new circumstances must be created in a way that effectively helps those interested to act in the direction desired.

    Once again: man should seek to serve, not to impose himself.

    Patience, perseverance and faith are qualities of great practical value in this work.

    For man to recognize his polar being, he must be fully attentive on all planes accessible to his consciousness. In fact, as a result of the distortion of the film, the meeting always occurs in circumstances and in a manner least expected, generally at a moment and in a form which resembles nothing he could ever have imagined.

    The rule is precise: to recognize his polar being, man must know himself.

    This is obviously logical: to recognize his alter ego, man must first recognize his own ego.

    We are thus confronted once again with the problem of the search for the way.

    It is true that the "I" of the body, like the "I" of the personality, aspire to find the perfect response from another being. This means that ONLY by identifying himself more and more with his REAL "I" that a man magnetizes the union with his polar being.

    It is with a heart full of faith, sharpening within himself his highest faculties of intuition and attention, his sense of critical analysis taken to the highest point of alertness, that man will go in search of the being without whom he is not real.

    As it was for the troubadour long ago, it is in Courtly Love that he can hope to find and recognize "la Dame de ses Pensees."

    The difficulty we find in discovering our polar beings lies in the fact that we are deformed, and constantly distort our film by free movements. We must rectify our own distortion and renounce our impulsive movements. This explains the prescription not to act under the influence of only one center. It is the necessity to correct for our distortion, which, logically, imposes on us the need, both in reception and transmission, for conscious effort to make our emotional and intellectual centers work together.

    When polar beings meet, by what immediately perceptible signs can humans who are still imperfect, still deformed by karmic debt, be certain in all objectivity that they are not making a mistake?

    Here are some indispensable criteria that can have objective value in mutual recognition.

    From the first meeting, in the presence of the polar being, both the "I" of the Personality and the "I" of the body vibrate in a manner which resembles nothing ever felt before.

    The reason for this is that these "I's" find themselves then in the presence of their First Love which continues through the centuries. Without clearly being conscious of it, the polar beings know each other; and this knowledge, as ancient as they are themselves, is expressed by the voice of their subconsciousness. This creates an atmosphere of absolute confidence and SINCERITY from the moment they meet.

    Q: (L) Last Sunday morning, I had a very strange experience similar to what Al-Arabi describes as being in a 'state.' It was like being taken up into a condition of near madness, Ark was there [as in a vision], and then, when [the intensity of the emotion] became unbearable, I deliberately pulled myself back and I was cold, shaking and rocking. I was shivering like I would never get warm and I could FEEL my soul rocking in my body. I would like to know exactly what this was?
    A: Balancing of half-self.
    Q: (L) What is a half-self?
    A: Your starter version, relating to birth karmic imprint.
    Q: (L) What in the world does THAT mean?
    A: What you were assigned with at the onset of this incarnation. What you started with. This must be periodically re-balanced at apex of significant junctures.
    Q: (L) The next thing that happened was that a few days later, I went unconscious and Ark saw me come in the window [5 thousand miles away]. What happened?
    A: Learning is fun!

    Q: As you know, there is a flood in Poland, and Ark has to go back, there is so much that must be done, but the government offices may be closed, the court session may be delayed indefinitely, God knows what is going to happen. What is the source of this dreadful disaster in Poland?
    A: Sopophoric screen alterations of the magnetic belt overlay.
    Q: And what is causing these screen alterations of the magnetic belt overlay?
    A: Influences of Acquiim.
    Q: What is Acquiim?
    A: 4th density overseer.
    Q: Does that mean sporofic screen alteration?
    A: Soporific/phosphorous.
    Q: What is the purpose of this screen alteration?
    A: Deterrence of colinear wave reading consciousness units.
    Q: What is a 'colinear wave reading consciousness unit?'
    A: Suggest you "look in the mirror."
    Q: Well! I don't know if I like being a colinear wave reading consciousness unit!
    A: Why not?
    Q: Because I don't like feeling responsible for all these people who are suffering in this disaster!
    A: Responsible? Are you altering the weather?
    Q: Well, no. But, if they will go to that extent to thwart us, is it safe for him to go back?
    A: If he takes precautions. [...]
    Q: When you said 'colinear wave reading consciousness units,' and 'look in the mirror,' was that a clue that Ark and I are mirror image consciousness units?
    A: Not exactly.
    Q: Well, in a previous session, you said something about being a 'half soul,' and my assumption was that he was a half-soul and I was a half-soul, and together we made a whole soul. But, since that time, I have wondered about this...
    A: No one is unto themselves a half soul.
    Q: Okay, what would give me a more clear understanding about 'half soul balancing?'
    A: The soul as read as a unit of completion. It is the communication which completes the whole in each.
    Q: What are the potentials of colinear wave reading consciousness units?
    A: Specifics.
    Q: Well, if an overseer in 4th density wishes to prevent unification of same, there must be some reason; that there is something that the 4th density STS would not like to see happen. What is it?
    A: Is that not self-evident?
    Q: So, does that mean that it is important for us to be physically together to do whatever this is?
    A: Tis preferable.

    This is the Touchstone: for polar beings do NOT LIE to each other. They do not need to lie, for inwardly both are one single being, from the depths of which the real "I" issues his call and gives his assent.

This is also true. Ark and I simply find it impossible to lie to each other. Even silly little "avoidances" become like huge barriers and we are compelled from inside to reveal every thought and feeling and idea. And this was true from the very beginning. We knew, somehow, that to lie would be a disaster.

    After this, that absolute, spontaneous sincerity constitutes the basis of their relationship.

    This gives these two beings an otherwise inconceivable feeling of Freedom in Unity, which ends the impression of servitude and isolation under which we ordinarily live.

    Soon afterwards, vague reminiscences of past experiences will start to come to the surface in their waking consciousness.

This was absolutely the case for both Ark and myself. Past life memories literally flooded into our waking and sleeping consciousnesses.

    The reader will now understand the deepest reason why lying to oneself is forbidden: he who lies to himself will also lie to his alter ego. That will be the end of the miracle.

    The wonderful side of the meeting will disappear behind a curtain of trivial lies, which will rapidly take the aspect of an impassable wall.

    This is how and why exterior man passes by his polar being without recognizing her. this is why practical work on the esoteric Way starts and necessarily continues with a struggle against lying to oneself. Success in this field is indispensable.

    To reach this aim, no price whatsoever is too high to pay.

    If they are open to the truth, and if their meeting makes chords - silent until now - vibrate in harmony within them both, the way is then marked out, for polar beings, by their conscious efforts to re-create the Micro cosmos which had formerly been dissociated and broken.

    They will traverse the Staircase like an arrow and will suddenly find themselves in front of the second Threshold.

    The catechumen crosses the First Threshold under the impetus of a negative feeling: the horror of life in the wilderness, and the ardent desire to escape from it.

    To reach the Second Threshold, the two polar beings who present themselves in front of it must be holders of a positive password, which will be required from them at that precise moment.

    The Way opens to those who know what they want; know what they aspire to, on the Way and outside the Way, in an exterior life which after this can never again be detached from esoteric work. Happy are those who can be useful in it.

    The Door which leads to Life will open before them, and they will read on the pediment of the wall the sacramental inscription:

    The laborer is worthy of his hire.

    C's have said:

        "If one has the will of a Lion, one does not have the fate of a mouse!" Arkadiusz is strong willed. Must be to be seeker of worlds. To paraphrase: "I am become ONE... Creator of worlds."

Commentary on Boris Mouravieff's Gnosis

      

    Every man is born bearing within him the image of his polar being.
    As he grows, this image grows within him;
    It takes form and is filled with life and colour.
    Man is not conscious of it. Yet it is his ALTER EGO,
    The Lady of his dreams, his Princess of the Vision.
    In Quest of her he must eternally go.

    In Her alone, he will find a perfect echo of Himself:
    Of the most intimate, inexpressible movements of his soul, For in their union, the limit between the I and the Thou is obliterated.

    Since she is his Singular, his Legitimate Spouse.
    And Silence will then be the depositary of the fullness of their Love.

    To live in the True, with all lies excluded, is the prerogative of the Cycle of the Spirit: Light without shadow.

    We speak here about certain human beings who have attained or who are about to attain the Second Birth. The text leaves no room for ambiguity:

        Lie not to one another: seeing that you have put off the old man with his doings and have put on the new man, that is being renewed until the knowledge after the image of God: where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave and freeman; but Christ is all and in all.

    This is only addressed to those who are on the Way in their relations between themselves.

    He who reaches Love would not know how to lie. But to triumph over lies requires an esoteric culture which is inaccessible to ordinary man.

    This highlights the important problem of lying.

    The struggle against lying is long and drawn out. It is first of all a struggle against ourselves, against our spontaneous tendencies, and against that mechanicalness that makes us revert constantly to lying.

    Useless lies to others are far less harmful than lying to oneself - and easier to master and heal. Lying to oneself sometimes takes on finely shaded forms that necessitate total and sustained attention, together with methodical and persistent efforts.

    to eliminate useless lying to others does not demand continual effort: one must simply watch to see that it does not slip into conversation. At the moment when it is on our lips a simple effort of attention is sufficient to stop it. That is why in struggling for truth, it is recommended to begin with this type of lie.

    But, we easily understand that lying to oneself, or the struggle against this kind of lie, is not perceptible from the exterior.

    When we stop lying uselessly, this will also be unnoticed by those around us. One can say that in practice, the struggle against these two categories of lies does not alter man's relations with other men in any way, although it is very effective for the person who undertakes it. We can therefore begin it without delay, as long as we do it discreetly so as not to draw attention to ourselves, and so do not provoke increasing pressure from the General Law [of accident and mechanicalness which will try to circumvent these efforts; i.e. The Predator's mind/Matrix.]

    [...] As for efforts at suppressing lies to oneself, they entail quite different and important consequences. Such lies grow deep roots. In this domain, paradoxical situations sometimes arise, some of them of such psychological subtlety that it is difficult to draw them out of the shade.

    Here we must mention the question of marriages where one of the partners, having realized that this union is an error, persists in trying to convince him or herself of the contrary. If he is of an affectionate nature, he will redouble his amiability towards his partner as if truly toward his polar "other." The absurdity of the situation reaches its limits if the other partner reacts by adopting a corresponding attitude - without any sincere or spontaneous glow of tenderness.

    The danger from the esoteric point of view is that, by mere force of habit, such a situation takes on for one of the partners, or even for both of them, the value of true love. this kind of lying to oneself can go on for dozens of years with people who are amiable and of good faith, and they entail tragic disillusions in the end.

    The man who starts to struggle against lying to himself must be forewarned of these difficulties, and of the possible collapse of some or all his greatest values.

    All should know that true esoteric work only begins after the individual has passed through a general bankruptcy and has had his gods helplessly thrown to the ground.

    We have indicated the absolute necessity for anyone who aspires to esoteric development to cure himself as soon as possible of this deep-rooted habit of lying to himself.

    We shall now look at this problem from another angle: that of the objective results which man obtains when he is able to stop lying.

    This work takes time, demands the courage to face disillusion, and needs self-confidence and faith in the self. As the seeker advances, he feels a new sentiment.

    He will sometimes feel bitter regret as his beautiful dreams vanish, but at the same time he will feel himself more and more liberated.

    His growing sincerity towards himself will establish an atmosphere of truth in his inner life. The law proclaimed "you shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free" will apply to him in its fullness.

    The word "free" was deliberately chosen to contrast a state of slavery.

    After each operation of inner purification, painful though it may be, the seeker will feel more and more fully a profound gratitude for being freed from this absurd slavery.

    Having reached a certain stage in internal liberation, the individual will understand the full value of the magical power expressed in the word Freedom.

    The acquisition of Inner Freedom is the sine qua non condition of further success in esoteric work.

    This elimination of lying to the self enables one to observe the work of the lower centers in the self objectively. This observation is commenced from this "command post" of impartial observation and judgment of the individual who has overcome the lies to the self.

    When our interior world is thus purified by these rays of the "B", when we have ceased to lie to ourselves, how then are we to act towards others?

    This problem is far from easy.

    It is written: "the kingdom of heaven is forced, and it is the violent men who hold it."

    If we remember that the kingdom of heaven is within, and NOT outside us, then we begin to understand that some force or even violence must be employed INTERNALLY to retake our own fortress.

    This is very often necessary to eliminate the roots of Illusion within us, the mother of lies to ourselves.

    Thus we see that the test at the fourth step is decisive. Until lying stops, man drags along the defects of his past: lying, weakness, self-pity, inner compromise.

    Generally, it takes time, the opportunity and the possibility to rid himself of his baggage before committing himself to the fourth step is met. Many individuals, because of the weight of their past, waste time and allow many opportunities which present themselves to go by.

    But, on the fourth step, the balance sheet must be drawn up and accounts settled. Man, poor and naked, is accepted at the second Threshold, but only on condition that he is consistent and pure.

    The essential is that he be consistent, meaning that he contains within himself true Love, which can only be revealed by the cessation of lying to the self.

    Everything false within him will be burned by the flames of this blazing sword.

    All of these steps happen more or less together in many combinations. They are distributed unequally according to different personalities, and driven by the force of our Desire to be free.

    In stepping onto the Staircase, to approach and then cross the Second Threshold, man adopts a new attitude towards himself: from this point on, he takes his fate in his own hands.

    During later development, the Individuality becomes progressively integrated with the higher cosmos.

    Cassiopaeans:
    Q: (L) Let me ask this one before the tape runs out and we take a break. What is the "ultimate secret" being protected by the Consortium?
    A: You are not in control of yourselves, you are an experiment. [...]
    Q: (L) Yes. Okay. How "long", and I put long in quotes, because we know, as you say, there is no time, but how long, as we measure it, have the Grays been interacting with our race? The Grays, not the Lizards, the Grays, the cybergenetic probes?
    A: No.
    Q: (L) What do you mean, "No"?
    A: Time travelers, therefore, "Time is ongoing."
    Q: (L) Okay, recently I read a couple of books Jan gave me, "Knight in Shining Armor" and "Replay". Both of these books described time travel.
    A: No, not finished with answer. Do you understand the gravity of last response?
    Q: (L) They are time travelers, they can move forward and backward in time, they can play games with our heads... (T) They can set up the past to create a future they want. (D) They can organize things so that they can create the energy that they need... (L) They can also make things look good, make them feel good, make them seem good, they can make you have an idea one minute, and then the next minute, create some sort of situation that confirms that idea...
    A: When you asked how long, of course it is totally unlimited, is it not?
    Q: (L) That's not good. If they were to move back through space time and alter an event in our past, would that alteration in the past instantaneously alter our present as well?
    A: Has over and over and over.
    Q: (D) So they do it over and over and over, constantly? (L) So, at each...
    A: You just are not yet aware, and have no idea of the ramifications!!!
    Q: (L) We're getting a little glimmer! Yeah, I do, a little! (T) The ramifications of being able to move in and out of time and manipulate it the way you want (Jan/Laura) And the ramifications of what they're doing to us; what they are doing to us and what they will do to us, over and over. (Freddy) What did it say about over and over? (L) So, in other words, our only real prayer in this whole damn situation is to get out of this density level. That's what they're saying, that's what it sounds like to me.
    A: Close.
    Q: (L) Because, otherwise, we're just literally, as in that book, stuck in the replay over and over and over, and the Holocaust could happen over and over, and we could just, you know... Genghis Khan, Attila the Hun... over and over and over again. (T) We're stuck in a time loop; they're putting us in a time loop. (J) Are we in a time loop?
    A: Yes.
    Q: (D) I have a question about... there was a... (PAUSE) Mankind has found it necessary for some reason or other to appoint time for some reason or other. The only reason I can see is to have a means of telling, like in verbal or written communications...
    A: Control mechanism.
    Q: (T) Is there a way for us to break the control mechanism? Besides moving to 4th density? (D) That was part...
    A: Nope.
    Q: (D) When 4th density beings communicate it's telepathic, right?
    A: Yes.
    Q: (D) Okay, since time doesn't exist, how do you communicate about happenings?
    A: Rephrase, please; clarify.
    Q: (L) What she means to ask is, if you're communicating telepathically... (D) On 4th density.. (L) And time doesn't exist, how do you communicate about events as one happens now, as opposed to later and the next thing happens, and the next thing happens... (J) How is it sequential?
    A: Translate.
    Q: (D) Translate? Okay, let me explain what I mean. I mean, we talk about 1907 something happened...
    A: That is how it is done.
    Q: (T) Translate is how it is done. You translate the experience?
    A: From 4 to 3. And vice versa.
    Q: (L) So, in other words, it's almost like making movies. (J) Are linear thought processes part of it? Is it being linear and non-linear?
    A: Part of 3d illusion only.
    Q: (L) So, in other words, if you're a 4th density being, everything is more or less happening, excuse the term happening, everything is simultaneous, and if you wish to discuss or communicate or have any focus upon any particular aspect of this unified dimension, then what you do is you kind of extract it out, project it into 3d...
    A: Close.
    Q: (L) ... like a movie.
    A: But you will not understand fully until you get there.

    Mouravieff: The life of man is a film. It is certainly difficult for our Cartesian minds to grasp this concept. Our three-dimensional minds are badly adapted to ideas and facts which touch on the domain of the eternal.

    Incomprehensible as it may seem, our life is truly a film produced in accordance with a script. This film goes on continuously, without ever stopping, in such a way that, at the time of his death, man is born again. What seems absurd is that he is born in the same place, at the same date where he was born before, and of the same parents. So the film goes on again. Each human being, then, is born with his own particular film. this represents the field of action in which man is called to apply his conscious efforts.

    The repetition of the film is not reincarnation, although these two notions are often confused. Exterior man, who lives in the system of the Future-Past cannot embrace in a single moment the ensemble of his film, nor even the part that contains his immediate future. To do so, he would need to enlarge the slot of his Present.

    It thus happens to him that, faced with certain events, he will feel that he has already seen or lived those events. Some see in such phenomena the proof of so called reincarnation. In reality, phenomena of this sort are the result of a casual and temporary surge of fine energies in the organism: the slot of the individual Present then enlarges for a few moment, and some significant facts of the immediate future slip into the waking consciousness. In this way, the impression is created of a return of another time. In a certain way this is true, although the impression of having lived before is only caused by mechanical unfolding of the film.

    By reincarnation, we must understand a phenomenon of a very different order. Although the theoretical film revolves integrally on the plane of possibilities, meaning in eternity, the film of the exterior man clings to the plane of realization, that is, of Time, but only to the extent strictly necessary to satisfy the ends of the Ray of Creation.

    True reincarnation, on the other hand, occurs entirely in time, and belongs integrally to the domain of the Real, well understood as part of the broader frame of Manifestation. The human personality is not a reality in the proper sense of the word, but a possibility. It plays a role in the film to which it is attached, from which it will not disappear until the moment of the Second Birth. At that moment, it will cease to be a Personality. Because of its indestructible union with the real "I", it will be transfigured, and so it will become an Individuality. As long as man lives in the wilderness, self-satisfied and immersed in lies and illusions, the film will unfold with mechanical inflexibility, and the Personality will remain entirely unchanged.

    These circumstances start to change the moment man crossed the first Threshold. This passage can be compared to the conception of the future Individuality. The Staircase symbolizes the period of gestation, and the crossing of the second Threshold represents the second Birth, the birth of Individuality. As man becomes more and more integrated with his "I", growing his Individuality, he becomes progressively integrated with the Cosmos and acquires "gifts" appropriate to his individual nature. Simultaneously, he progressively participates in real, objective existence, which finally characterizes his being.

    This is liberation from the bonds of the film.

    It is only at this point of evolution that true individual reincarnation becomes possible.

    True reincarnation is not mechanical; it is done consciously, generally to accomplish a mission.

    Cassiopaeans:
    Q: (LC) Well, if that's the case! I want to ask about past life relations between us. I'm sure there is.
    A: Be specific.
    Q: (LC) Are there any specific past life connections between any of the women in this room?
    A: Who?
    Q: (LC) Well, let's start with Laura. Do I have a past life connection with Laura?
    A: Before we answer that, we wish to hear from you what you perceive a past life circumstance to be.
    [..] How do you perceive the reincarnation process to be?
    Q: (LC) I perceive it as you come back with people you choose to come back with, and that you choose people that you are karmically connected to. (I) I see it a little bit differently than that...
    A: Aha! We have a variance!
    Q: (I) I think that when we die and go to 5th density, that we make pacts with people in each incarnation, so when you come back, it is coming back to fulfill that pact. (LC) Yes, that is the way my line of thinking is going. But, when they asked that question, I was thinking that you have people you come back with because of closeness. Somebody may be your mother in one life, and there is a love bond, and then there are other people that you come back with because you have to resolve something to let go of that person rather than to get closer.
    A: This is partially correct. But, there is more to it than this. For example, one can incarnate on various planes of existence, not just the one you perceive currently. And, one may actually reincarnate on more than one plane concurrently, if one is advanced enough to do this.
    Q: (L) Are you suggesting that ...
    A: Yes, we are!
    Q: (L) I was thinking it, but they didn't let me finish. For the record, I was thinking that we are all part of the same soul unit here.
    A: To an extent, but you may not yet understand what exactly a "soul unit" is in that sense. And of course, there is more than one sense for this as well. The "trick" that 3rd density STS life forms will learn, either prior to transition to 4th density, or at the exact juncture, is to think in absolutely limitless terms. The first and most solid step in this process is to not anticipate at all. This is most difficult for you. We understand this, but this as also why we keep reiterating this point. For example, imagine if one of your past lives is also a future life? [...]
    Q: (P) Now, I just want to say that I think that we have all of us here traveled back in time to change the way things are now. We inserted ourselves into this time period to wake up and see what is really happening. This is 3rd density thinking, I know, but it is the only way I can describe it. We looked back on the way things happened, the way the world is now, and we have come back to change things. We have come from the future, to wake up now, because we didn't wake up before. (C) Maybe that's our "past life/future life" connection here? (P) Right, we all agreed to insert ourselves in this time line.... (L) So, we ARE from the future... (P) Because the world is going in this direction, and SOMETHING had to be done. That's what I see. (I) Yes. We all decided to come back, but there was a strong possibility that we would not be able to wake up and link up. And that's why so many things happened to attempt to keep us from getting together. (P) Not just that, things happen to keep us from waking up period! We've all been bombarded with stuff all our lives. (I) Yes, and when we started waking up, and realized that we HAD to come together to "link" to DO whatever it is we are going to do, there has to be all kinds of things to prevent it even! [Laughter] (S) I would like to ask a question about synchronicity...
    A: Wait a minute... someone said something a short while ago that is surprisingly close to the truth. Now just a moment... reflect please.
    Q: (L) P*** was saying that we have come back from the future and inserted ourselves into this timeline...
    A: Yes. That is close to being totally correct!
    Q: (L) In terms of reincarnation, that we were talking about a few minutes before that, we are possibly incarnations of ourselves incarnated at different levels. This just happens to be one of the levels of reality that we are occupying, but there are other selves at other levels thinking and doing other level stuff, and these other levels are perceived by us as the future...
    A: Maybe for some of you, but let us not get ahead of ourselves.
    Q: (P) The C's say that they are US in the future. So, we, being THEM in the future, some of who they are in the future, have come back as us, to do what we are doing, to undo what is happening on Earth...
    A: Close, but more complex than that. It would be difficult for you to completely understand at this point, but let us just say that you are close.

    Mouravieff: It is important to grasp clearly the difference which exists between the film, a mixture of possibilities, and reincarnation in time, which belongs to the domain of the Real, and to understand the meaning of this difference.

    At the time of the second Birth, that is to say, by crossing the Second Threshold, man escapes his bondage to the film, and enters the domain of redemption. He is then admitted into the sacred brotherhood of living Beings. These beings are an unshakable force: those who are part of it are no longer subject to illness or sorrow. Death loses its hold over them. They have overcome the world.

    In theory, the film in which man is born and in which he lives can go on until the end of the world, on condition that he is happy, satisfied with himself, attributing his virtues to himself, and blaming others for his mistakes and misfortunes. Properly speaking, this kind of existence cannot be considered as human; it could be described as anthropoid. This term is justified in the sense that exterior man, immersed in self-satisfaction, represents the crowning achievement of millions of years of evolution of the species from its animal ancestors, yet from the point of view of esoteric evolution, he is a possibility which has not yet been realized.

    If we envisage the problem of esoteric evolution from the point of view of the film and the different parts man can play in it, it is clear that this kind of evolution is impossible as long as the film can always be considered as turning in the same circle. People who perform in such a film are those we have called anthropoids, puppets, the dead who, in the words of Jesus, "believe themselves to be alive."

    Esoteric evolution starts when man, by his conscious efforts, proves capable of breaking the circle and transforming it into an ascending spiral. The spiral represents an intermediate state between the position where the human Personality is found to be trapped in the film, which revolves mechanically in a way hardly separated from the eternal plane, and that of the perfect, free Individuality, who is able, if need arises, to reincarnate consciously in Time.

    This is an intermediate state in this sense, that the film definitely departs from the plane of the eternal, from the plane of possibilities. The curve of life, which for exterior man does not in practice differ from a circle, transforms itself into a spiral and does not end - as it did previously - almost at its point of departure: the distance between these two points now marks a definite progression in Time.

    The film in the form of a spiral belongs to human beings who climb the staircase. Complete disengagement of the film is produced at the moment of crossing the second threshold. If man is able to do that successfully during a single life, so breaking the circle for the very first time, he does not return to it. Such a case is very rare: it is the lot of the just.

    Generally, this liberation requires several lives; several revolutions of the spiral. As a general rule, each revolution occurs in Time, and consequently can appear to be a reincarnation. In reality, it is nothing but a return to exterior life. A pseudo-reincarnation like this is neither conscious nor personal: it is the actors in the film who return, and they do not remember any previous experiences.

    However, a change is possible as soon as the conscious efforts of man increase the effect of the Time factor by enlarging perception of the Present. In a film which unfolds in a spiral in this way, the contents of the play change; they change in two ways: first in each life, that is, during each revolution, and also from spiral to spiral. The composition of the cast, the circumstances, and the scenery all change. Two elements however remain permanent: first, the general aim, to reach and cross the second Threshold; then the absolute condition for crossing this Threshold, that all the karmic debts which have been accumulated in the present life, as well as during previous spirals, must be neutralized and liquidated.

    Before the Second Threshold, every drama must be played out to its denouement. The work is hard and difficult because man constantly makes mistakes.

    The attentive reader has already understood that following the spiral, or climbing the Staircase, is reserved for human beings who have already absorbed a certain quantity of "B" influences and who thus possess a more or less developed magnetic center. This does not guarantee that they will make no more errors.

    It is true that from the time man first mounts the Staircase he is watched, especially if he makes sincere and considerable efforts. The Esoteric Brotherhood offers him a helping hand. Certain meetings, a play of favorable circumstances, are the forms taken by this help. This assistance does not, however, free him of the need to work on himself and to go on making conscious efforts. In addition, it must be said that often the proffered help is not used, because man does not listen to the advice given, or because he does not grasp the meaning of the favorable circumstances and the possibilities of progress which open before him. He is still more than half a creature of the domain of Illusion, he continues to take frequent impulsive decisions, and often turns against his own avowed aims.

    It must be understood that as long as a man has not attained and crossed the Second Threshold, he will have to start all over again. He will restart every spiral in the wilderness, he will once again have to discern the Cosmic Solar influences, cross the First Threshold, and climb the Staircase step by step. It is true that no conscious effort is ever lost, but the experience acquired in one spiral only appears in the next in the form of innate personal aptitudes, or vague recollections of people in the cast.

    We should know that, at the end of a spiral (incarnation), a comparison is made between the film as it was conceived at the time of birth and what it has become at the time of death. The balance sheet between these two states is drawn up, as in accounting, by listing assets and liabilities, followed by a profit/loss statement. This will show the result of the elapsed life objectively.

    This balance sheet furnishes the basic elements for composing the film at the start of the following spiral.

    If we could avoid all errors and complications in this new experience, produced as a result of free movements, esoteric evolution would then occur in a harmonious rising curve.

    Generally, this is not the case. Man most often comes to this idea of evolution after he has already complicated the film to which he belongs.

    But true evolution cannot occur except on the basis of the original film - after all artificially added elements have been eliminated. The latter is conditional on a return to the PURITY of the centers, especially the emotional center which - at least at the start - is the sole receptacle of Cosmic Solar influences.

    Cassiopaeans:
    Q: (L) Are instincts different from emotions?
    A:Yes.
    Q: (L) How can you tell the difference between instinctive knowledge and emotional reactions?
    A: Emotions involve wishful thinking, instincts are "gut feelings," psychic in nature, and are stronger. When it is wishful thinking, there is always psychic instinct seeping through which you can access if you use reason and examine your lessons of the past.
    Q: (L) Is it also correct that emotion can be used to mislead, that is emotions that are twisted and generated strictly from the flesh or false programming?
    A: Emotion that limits is an impediment to progress. Emotion is also necessary to make progress in 3rd density. It is natural. When you begin to separate limiting emotions based on assumptions from emotions that open one to unlimited possibilities, that means you are preparing for the next density.
    Q: (L) What about Love?
    A: What about it?
    Q: (L) There are many teachings that are promulgated that Love is the key, the answer. They say that illumination and knowledge and what-not can all be achieved through love.
    A: The problem is not the term "love," the problem is the interpretation of the term. Those on third density have a tendency to confuse the issue horribly. After all, they confuse many things as love. When the actual definition of love as you know it is not correct either. It is not necessarily a feeling that one has that can also be interpreted as an emotion, but rather, as we have told you before, the essence of light which is knowledge is love, and this has been corrupted when it is said that love leads to illumination. Love is Light is Knowledge. Love makes no sense when common definitions are used as they are in your environment. To love you must know. And to know is to have light. And to have light is to love. And to have knowledge is to love.

    Mouravieff:
    The heart must therefore be pure, and if not already pure, it must be purified. This is the sine qua non condition of success.

    All the discussion of lying in all its aspects is given to emphasize the absolute need for purifying the heart, and for beginning to re-educate the emotional center in a positive direction. [Remember, the emotions are represented by the horse pulling the coach.]

    This necessity explains the meaning of the words of Jesus: "Except you turn, and become as little children, you shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven."

    This refers specifically to the emotional life. Many have interpreted this as a restriction on the development of the intellect. This is a huge mistake. Intelligence and intellect must be developed and stimulated. The admonition to "become as little children" only points to the need for purity of the centers, NOT the idea of keeping them in a primitive state.

    Paul wrote: Brothers, be not children in that which concerns judgment, be children in what concerns malice, but as to judgment, be fully grown men."

    It is now time to turn to a possible short cut in esoteric work which can rapidly take us to the second Threshold.

    This is a possibility offered to Polar beings, those couples described by the ancient Tradition in the myth of the Androgyne.

    On the basis of the preceding analysis, the essential data for the film of any ordinary person can be described as follows: as the hero of the romance of his own life, the subject must necessarily be the star of the film.

    But he can also play a minor role in the film of people who play a secondary role in his own film. In this way, each film gets enmeshed with other films, where the same people are found in totally different situations.

    One must also distinguish between two categories of actors.

    The first are really part of the cast. A definite role is assigned to them: they are organically tied to the film.

    The second group only appear by accident in the film, drawn into the action by the free movements of the hero. This complexity is further increased because some of the actors who have genuine parts in the film play their roles badly, while others play roles which are not their own. Situations like this are widespread.

    The human Personality is an organism with multiple parts or facets, 987 to be exact. In the ideal case, only realized by polar beings, and the only effective one from the esoteric point of view, the 987 facets of man and woman are strictly polar. These are the predestined husband and wife whose union will create a true couple.

    However, the cast contains other people, who play roles organically tied to that of the hero, and who are necessary to bring the film in its ensemble to its natural end. these are friend souls, brother souls, sister souls, collaborating souls, servant souls, etc. The Personalities of each of them have a certain number of facts identical to those of the hero, for actors of the same sex, or polar for actors of the opposite sex. In the case of brothers and sisters, the number of identical or polar facets can be as many as half or even more.

    The lack of discernment and of sincerity towards ourselves, the innate desire to find a perfect resonance to the vibration of our soul, and the impatience that follows, all multiplied by the action of the General Law [of accident], induce us too often to contract unions which can only result in absurd situations. Instead of resisting the mirage; instead of waiting and seeking, we slip into imperfect unions, which are a source of suffering both for the partners and their children. In addition, these unions alter the meaning of the film in its ensemble, and so corrupt the personal lives of all the actors in the drama. Lastly, the esoteric results foreseen in the initial composition of the film are gravely compromised.

    It is as a result of considering on the matrimonial plane, or through lack of consideration on the sexual plane, that most of our errors are committed, including those which demand the heaviest payment.

    Even beings of good faith are not exempt from error.

    To confuse a brother or sister soul for husband or wife compounds very complicated situations, especially from the esoteric point of view. The situation is all the more confused when children are born from such unions.

    Life then takes on the character of a perpetual compromise with oneself. the moral and physical health of "accidentally united couples" suffers: with changes in the intellectual center due to cheating and lying; heart disease if the emotional center is sensitive and still aspires to the truth; also diseases of obscure origin, of which cancer is one that attacks the body in its most fragile parts. In every case, the condition necessarily leads to permanent loss of fine energies which, in its turn, brings on accelerated aging and leads to premature death.

    Difficult as are these situations that arise out of our errors, they must not prevent anyone who throws himself into esoteric work from finding the courage in himself to look them in the face and to search for a satisfactory outcome. If the Devil - the General Law - tries to lead us into new errors to obstruct our esoteric evolution, the supporting hand of the Lord is always stretched out to help us. Yet our minds, too rational and too realistic, often stop us from sensing this help.

    When a situation has been entangled by our errors, the Gordian knot must NOT be cut, it must be untied in such a way that the participants, both tied by the same knot, feel only relief at the disappearance of a situation which was simply a source of suffering for both.

    If the situation is resolved, the original meaning of the film and its normal development can be found.

    The ensemble of people organically linked in one film forms a team. In the initial conception of the film, this team must attain a predetermined aim as a result of the way the participants play their roles in the play of life. This esoteric aim is always different from the aims we follow under the influences of the General Law [the Matrix]

    The objective for such a team always has an esoteric meaning in fact, though the Personalities which compose it may be very different. they will share a deep need: a desire to end lies and illusions once and for all, the escape the domination of the [Predator's mind] and, in one form or another, to reach that objective existence in which man finds his real "I" and identifies himself with it.

    Here we must describe the principal law which underlies the formation of these teams. On the material plane, the greatest reward goes to him who commands. On the esoteric plane, the greatest reward goes to him who serves.

    The confusion between these two important master ideas - that of commanding and of serving - sometimes appears dramatic. Even among Jesus' disciples, the question of knowing who was greatest among them tormented them.

    The more evolved the team, the more important the task entrusted to it. History provides examples of the work of teams in all fields. the role of women in teams is particularly marked in crucial periods of the history of peoples.

    [...]Once the First Threshold is crossed, esoteric work will begin to reveal the true meaning of the film. Man must proceed with an impartial analysis of its contents: the role that each of the actors plays in it - and the value of this role - must be passed through a sieve.

    Gradually, as this stripping work progresses, the positive or negative character of different roles emerges more and more clearly. After this, inappropriate elements tend to disappear from the scene.

    At the end of this analysis, the film will contain only a reduced number of actors. but all of them are organically bound together, and with the hero, by the contents of the play, as it was conceived from the beginning of these experiences... which are pursued by the real "I" through centuries or even millennia. The play must then be played out to its resolution or denouement.

    The basic task of man, once he has crossed the first Threshold, is to shelter himself from the karmic influences which are the effects of errors committed in his free movements, either in the present life or in the past. In the past, workers used to go to some monastery or hermitage where they were able to concentrate on introspective work. In the present, our times require energetic and rapid methods.

    Our last question is to examine the method whereby the Staircase between the two Thresholds can be climbed more quickly, while we remain and work in the contemporary world.

    This means exists: it is to work as a couple. However, for this esoteric work to be completed successfully by two people, it is essential that the two beings - man and woman - are integrally polar.

    Cassiopaeans:
    Q: (L) Let me ask a question. Earlier they said something about being on the threshold of an experience. And now they say something is going to unfold in front of you. Are the two response "threshold" and "unfold in front of you," connected?
    A: Of course!!!
    Q: (L) Okay, he is on the threshold of some kind of experience. Is there some way that we might identify this experience? Is it going to be so outstanding that you can't miss it? Or, is it going to be something that you have to pay attention to or you might miss it?
    A: What does "threshold" imply?
    Q: (L) Well, a door. It's a door. Does this mean he is going to go through a door, psychically, spiritually, physically? Going to someone's house?
    A: It does not just imply a "door," but also one's positioning, and a sense of inevitability.
    Q: (L) Is there something I can do to help?
    A: Have you not helped already?
    Q: (L) But, I mean specifically in this "threshold" and "unfolding" experience?
    A: Yes! And, by the way, Arkadiusz, science is most spiritual indeed!
    Q: (L) Well, considering certain other elements, I was just wondering if our pathways are supposed to now be parallel or diverge... how they relate from this point...
    A: Seems to us that your pathways are intertwining!
    Q: (L) The use of the word "intertwining" is curious. You used that in regard to the relationship between EM and gravity. Is there a parallel?
    A: If you wish. [...]
    Q: (L) One last question: you say "combine energies." Is there any reason why this will facilitate the pursuit of answers?
    A: Complementary souls.

    Mouravieff:
    In the "long path," by successive elimination based on long and minute analysis of his film, and after new errors and new failures, man may end by finding his legitimate spouse, a fully integral polar being with whom to unite himself.

    In the "short path", man must begin by a conscious search for his polar being. If found, they can work together on the film which - in its origin - is common to them both.

    A man alone is incomplete. But just where he is weak, his polar being is strong. together, they form an integral being: their union leads to the fusion of their Personalities and a faster crystallization of their complete subtle bodies, united into a common second Birth.

    This is the redemption of "original sin."

    The system of films is conceived in such a way that polar beings will necessarily meet in life, in certain cases more than once. Only the confused ties contracted in this life by each of them, as a result of their free movements, combined with the karmic consequences of one or more previous experiences, can divert the man or woman from the ONLY being with whom they could from a Micro cosmos.

    If there were no karmic debt, everything would go wonderfully: two young people would meet in the most favorable family and social atmosphere, and their union would represent a true fairy-tale. But this is not reality.

    Obeying the principle of Imperfection, and moved by the action of the General Law, the two predestined beings will commit errors. Deeply buried in lies, they do not generally know how to appreciate the gift they are given. Often, they do not even recognize each other.

    If this is the case, then an agonizing question is put: is there one or more means to detect our polar being, and if so, what are these means?

    To meet that person, to do so without recognition, to let our polar being pass by, is the worst mistake we could possibly make: because we would remain in our factitious life, without light.

    Must not everything be sacrificed in favor of a union which is the only chance of our life: the promise of return to paradise lost?

    Nevertheless we should beware of the last trap, one we can fall into just at the moment when ineffable happiness seems to smile upon us.

    We have just said: all must be sacrifices; we have not said: all must be broken.

    If, having recognized one another, the two polar beings triumph over this last ordeal or test, often the most painful, the new life, will open in front of them, as they are then called to be One on earth and in heaven.

    But let us now return to the question of knowing how not to pass by after having met our true alter ago, the pledge of happiness and salvation.

    There is a whole series of subjective and objective clues which assist us in recognizing our polar being. The polarization is manifested on ALL planes simultaneously: sexual, physical, mental and spiritual.

    Two elements must be taken into consideration: If it is correct to say that the predestined man and woman are absolutely polar beings, this polarity is not simple because, to a certain measure, both are physically, mentally and spiritually hermaphroditic beings. That measure, that proportion, is at the same time, sufficient and necessary. It is necessary to permit every being coming into this world to carry within himself the image of the polar being; this image is expressed, in each case, by means of the organ of the opposite sex which exists in every being in a state of non-development. It is, so to say, a part of the flesh and blood of his polar being that each one of us carries within himself. this proportion is sufficient, that is, it is the absolute minimum that will not jeopardize the complete polarity, since the proportion of hermaphroditism in both polar beings is strictly equivalent.

    The second element, which is subjective, is the distortion of our personality due to conscious or unconscious deviations to which the initial film was subject during the course of our existence. Distortions of this kind make it more difficult to recognize the polar being, and can make us less willing to exert ourselves to unite with that being.

    [...] It is the Androgyne who constitutes a true Micro cosmos, not the isolated man or woman. The creation of man in the image and likeness of god was in the form of the Androgyne: this description refers to the joint astral body of two polar beings.

    For man as for woman, salvation in the bosom of the Absolute depends on their reintegration in the Micro cosmos, as Paul indicates explicitly: "neither is the woman without the man, nor the man without the woman in the Lord."

    Man and woman are in fact, incomplete beings who - taken apart - cannot reflect in His fullness the image of God who is all in all.

    it is an axiom that every man and every woman has a polar being.

    Nevertheless, not all human beings feel the imperative need to be united to their polar being. Beings who live enclosed in their Personality without thinking deeply - which constitutes the great majority of humanity - enthusiastically involve themselves in a life ruled by material influences, and do not really feel the need for such a union. For them, the polar being is on the same plane as everyone else. The Personality does not perceive anything exceptional in him, and if by some chance an extraordinary impression is experienced, it is instead felt as something abnormal and embarrassing.

    We can speak of couples formed under the influence of the Law of Accident in which the partners have opposite aspirations. At the base of such unions we often find, beside a double error of judgment, the influences of karmic debt, remote or recent. the most intelligent attitude to take on such occasions is to unite the efforts of the couple to unravel the situation to their mutual benefit. Left to itself, the situation will only get worse.

    Very special care must be taken of the children of such a union, as they suffer within the union. Everything must be done to remedy this. As a general rule, we must not lose sight of the fact that, even if it is permitted to the human being to offer himself in sacrifice, he has no right to accept the sacrifice of others. To sacrifice yourself to a union that is formed under the law of accident only teaches your children to do likewise and hinders their possibilities of ever discovering their own polar being.

    Accelerated evolution of the hero of a film via work on the self - i.e. purification - brings him ever nearer to his polar being. At the same time, it automatically removes from the film those personalities who are not organically integral.

    After the formation of the magnetic center within him, man starts to feel the desire, the need, to be united to his polar being. This desire and need will increase in proportion to the growth of the latter.

    The concept of the Androgyne has purely mythical or theoretical value for ordinary man. But we now realize that a living aspiration to be re-integrated in the Micro cosmos - the most direct way to the re-integration in the Absolute - is the fruit of a high moral culture within the individual.

    As mentioned, esoteric evolution is conditioned at the start by bankruptcy, a moral breakdown. To make progress after this, man must know exactly where he stands. He must SEE himself.

    Isaac the Syrian said that he who has been able to see himself as he IS, is better than he who has seen angels.

    what we call bankruptcy, the ancient traditions call "death." It is death while still in a living body. One must first die, then be resurrected.

     By progressively taking his fate into his own hands, man at the same time takes responsibility for ALL the partners in his film.

    He must restore the original meaning of his film, then push the development of the latter in such a way that the "play" be properly played out to its intended denouement.

    The hero, while working on himself, must apply himself to create new circumstances around him, which will enhance the unfolding of the action towards its originally intended conclusion.

    His exterior efforts must above all be directed towards the creation of these circumstances, NOT towards seeking direct influence over people. Such direct influence over people may seem opportune, but it is an error. Instead of unraveling the situation, the influence creates karmic debts which complicate things all the more. One must be very prudent and circumspect.

    Yet new circumstances must be created in a way that effectively helps those interested to act in the direction desired.

    Once again: man should seek to serve, not to impose himself.

    Patience, perseverance and faith are qualities of great practical value in this work.

    For man to recognize his polar being, he must be fully attentive on all planes accessible to his consciousness. In fact, as a result of the distortion of the film, the meeting always occurs in circumstances and in a manner least expected, generally at a moment and in a form which resembles nothing he could ever have imagined.

    The rule is precise: to recognize his polar being, man must know himself.

    This is obviously logical: to recognize his alter ego, man must first recognize his own ego.

    We are thus confronted once again with the problem of the search for the way.

    It is true that the "I" of the body, like the "I" of the personality, aspire to find the perfect response from another being. This means that ONLY by identifying himself more and more with his REAL "I" that a man magnetizes the union with his polar being.

    It is with a heart full of faith, sharpening within himself his highest faculties of intuition and attention, his sense of critical analysis taken to the highest point of alertness, that man will go in search of the being without whom he is not real.

    As it was for the troubadour long ago, it is in Courtly Love that he can hope to find and recognize "la Dame de ses Pensees."

    The difficulty we find in discovering our polar beings lies in the fact that we are deformed, and constantly distort our film by free movements. We must rectify our own distortion and renounce our impulsive movements. This explains the prescription not to act under the influence of only one center. It is the necessity to correct for our distortion, which, logically, imposes on us the need, both in reception and transmission, for conscious effort to make our emotional and intellectual centers work together.

    When polar beings meet, by what immediately perceptible signs can humans who are still imperfect, still deformed by karmic debt, be certain in all objectivity that they are not making a mistake?

    Here are some indispensable criteria that can have objective value in mutual recognition.

    From the first meeting, in the presence of the polar being, both the "I" of the Personality and the "I" of the body vibrate in a manner which resembles nothing ever felt before.

    The reason for this is that these "I's" find themselves then in the presence of their First Love which continues through the centuries. Without clearly being conscious of it, the polar beings know each other; and this knowledge, as ancient as they are themselves, is expressed by the voice of their subconsciousness. This creates an atmosphere of absolute confidence and SINCERITY from the moment they meet.

    Q: (L) Last Sunday morning, I had a very strange experience similar to what Al-Arabi describes as being in a 'state.' It was like being taken up into a condition of near madness, Ark was there [as in a vision], and then, when [the intensity of the emotion] became unbearable, I deliberately pulled myself back and I was cold, shaking and rocking. I was shivering like I would never get warm and I could FEEL my soul rocking in my body. I would like to know exactly what this was?
    A: Balancing of half-self.
    Q: (L) What is a half-self?
    A: Your starter version, relating to birth karmic imprint.
    Q: (L) What in the world does THAT mean?
    A: What you were assigned with at the onset of this incarnation. What you started with. This must be periodically re-balanced at apex of significant junctures.
    Q: (L) The next thing that happened was that a few days later, I went unconscious and Ark saw me come in the window [5 thousand miles away]. What happened?
    A: Learning is fun!

    Q: As you know, there is a flood in Poland, and Ark has to go back, there is so much that must be done, but the government offices may be closed, the court session may be delayed indefinitely, God knows what is going to happen. What is the source of this dreadful disaster in Poland?
    A: Sopophoric screen alterations of the magnetic belt overlay.
    Q: And what is causing these screen alterations of the magnetic belt overlay?
    A: Influences of Acquiim.
    Q: What is Acquiim?
    A: 4th density overseer.
    Q: Does that mean sporofic screen alteration?
    A: Soporific/phosphorous.
    Q: What is the purpose of this screen alteration?
    A: Deterrence of colinear wave reading consciousness units.
    Q: What is a 'colinear wave reading consciousness unit?'
    A: Suggest you "look in the mirror."
    Q: Well! I don't know if I like being a colinear wave reading consciousness unit!
    A: Why not?
    Q: Because I don't like feeling responsible for all these people who are suffering in this disaster!
    A: Responsible? Are you altering the weather?
    Q: Well, no. But, if they will go to that extent to thwart us, is it safe for him to go back?
    A: If he takes precautions. [...]
    Q: When you said 'colinear wave reading consciousness units,' and 'look in the mirror,' was that a clue that Ark and I are mirror image consciousness units?
    A: Not exactly.
    Q: Well, in a previous session, you said something about being a 'half soul,' and my assumption was that he was a half-soul and I was a half-soul, and together we made a whole soul. But, since that time, I have wondered about this...
    A: No one is unto themselves a half soul.
    Q: Okay, what would give me a more clear understanding about 'half soul balancing?'
    A: The soul as read as a unit of completion. It is the communication which completes the whole in each.
    Q: What are the potentials of colinear wave reading consciousness units?
    A: Specifics.
    Q: Well, if an overseer in 4th density wishes to prevent unification of same, there must be some reason; that there is something that the 4th density STS would not like to see happen. What is it?
    A: Is that not self-evident?
    Q: So, does that mean that it is important for us to be physically together to do whatever this is?
    A: Tis preferable.

    ***

    This is the Touchstone: for polar beings do NOT LIE to each other. They do not need to lie, for inwardly both are one single being, from the depths of which the real "I" issues his call and gives his assent.

This is also true. Ark and I simply find it impossible to lie to each other. Even silly little "avoidances" become like huge barriers and we are compelled from inside to reveal every thought and feeling and idea. And this was true from the very beginning. We knew, somehow, that to lie would be a disaster.

    After this, that absolute, spontaneous sincerity constitutes the basis of their relationship.

    This gives these two beings an otherwise inconceivable feeling of Freedom in Unity, which ends the impression of servitude and isolation under which we ordinarily live.

    Soon afterwards, vague reminiscences of past experiences will start to come to the surface in their waking consciousness.

This was absolutely the case for both Ark and myself. Past life memories literally flooded into our waking and sleeping consciousnesses.

    The reader will now understand the deepest reason why lying to oneself is forbidden: he who lies to himself will also lie to his alter ego. That will be the end of the miracle.

    The wonderful side of the meeting will disappear behind a curtain of trivial lies, which will rapidly take the aspect of an impassable wall.

    This is how and why exterior man passes by his polar being without recognizing her. this is why practical work on the esoteric Way starts and necessarily continues with a struggle against lying to oneself. Success in this field is indispensable.

    To reach this aim, no price whatsoever is too high to pay.

    If they are open to the truth, and if their meeting makes chords - silent until now - vibrate in harmony within them both, the way is then marked out, for polar beings, by their conscious efforts to re-create the Micro cosmos which had formerly been dissociated and broken.

    They will traverse the Staircase like an arrow and will suddenly find themselves in front of the second Threshold.

    The catechumen crosses the First Threshold under the impetus of a negative feeling: the horror of life in the wilderness, and the ardent desire to escape from it.

    To reach the Second Threshold, the two polar beings who present themselves in front of it must be holders of a positive password, which will be required from them at that precise moment.

    The Way opens to those who know what they want; know what they aspire to, on the Way and outside the Way, in an exterior life which after this can never again be detached from esoteric work. Happy are those who can be useful in it.

    The Door which leads to Life will open before them, and they will read on the pediment of the wall the sacramental inscription:

    The laborer is worthy of his hire.

    C's have said:

        "If one has the will of a Lion, one does not have the fate of a mouse!" Arkadiusz is strong willed. Must be to be seeker of worlds. To paraphrase: "I am become ONE... Creator of worlds."

Article - Laura Knight-Jadczyk
Commentary on Boris Mouravieff's Gnosis

    Based on our extensive scientific research, the planet is about to "rock and  roll" - we figure about 2009 give or take six months - and this is the material  manifestation of the "cyclic event" of the "cosmic shock," so to say.  

    Having now Mouravieff's piece of the puzzle, I have just assembled from my  notes a little book (well, maybe not so little) entitled "Ancient Science,"  I will send you  a copy for review.  I will paste in here part of the introduction which serves  to explicate some of our ideas:

    After over thirty years of research, the one thing that has become evident is  that the energies of Creation emanate "downward," and our individuality as  human beings is merely an expression of the "Theological Dramas," so to say.   To attempt to exert our will or to make our voice travel "upward," against  Creation results only in a clash of forces.   It is, in essence, an attempt to  violate the Free Will of Creation, i.e. Hubris.  This is why praying for  material changes, rituals designed to "change" reality, "positive thinking"  with the "intent" to change something "up there," in order to receive the  benefits "down here," is always doomed to produce more strife, misery and  suffering globally.  "Seek ye first the kingdom of Heaven..." and this kingdom  is - or CAN be - within.

    In other words, what we CAN do is to prepare ourselves for the emanations that  are traveling "downward" to be better received.  This is the essential point of  Castaneda's Don Juan when he said:

    One of the greatest accomplishments of the seers of the Conquest was a  construct he called the three-phase progression.  By understanding the nature  of man, they were able to reach the incontestable conclusion that if seers can  hold their own in facing [human] petty tyrants, they can certainly face the  unknown with impunity, and then they can even stand the presence of the  unknowable.

     

    The average man's reaction is to think that the order of that statement should  be reversed," he went on. "A seer who can hold his own in the face of the  unknown can certainly face petty tyrants. But that's not so. What destroyed the  superb seers of ancient times was that assumption. We know better now. We know  that nothing can temper the spirit of a warrior as much as the challenge of  dealing with impossible people in positions of power. Only under those  conditions can warriors acquire the sobriety and serenity to stand the pressure  of the unknowable.11 Castaneda, Carlos, The Fire From Within

     

    All around us we see the results of this error: the idea that we can exert our  will and voice upward to change what is "above" us in order to change our  reality.  This idea is at the root of rites and rituals, demanding, pleading,  visualizations, "workings," and so forth.  When people think that "meditating  on compassion," or "feeling the feelings of all beings," is going to result in  the "sonic entrainment of the heart's rhythm [being] braided into more complex  and coherent patterns," which will then enable the person to "create a diamond  imperishable body for use as a teaching vehicle down here on earth," has missed  the entire point.  To compare such ideas to the true work of Seeker of  Ascension is simply ignorant.

    An extensive study of the historical literature shows that those who actually  MAY HAVE achieved Ascension don't just sit down one day and meditate on  compassion or the feeling of oneness and "boom!" experience an "implosive soul  force."  Before Ascension can ever achieved the point of being able to think  even momentarily about "the oneness of all beings," or the "feelings of all  beings," the REAL seekers have spent many, many years in the struggle to "face  petty tyrants," or to fully REALIZE objective reality.  He has repeatedly  exposed himself to as many "unpleasant experiences" as he can find, all the  while struggling to master his emotions, his desires, his physicality.  It is  the work of making the physical vehicle "down here," receptive to whatever may  be "up there," as opposed to trying to forcibly create something "up there," in  order to have it "down here." 

    Nevertheless, the many teachers of ascension continue to expound on the subject  by saying such interesting things as: "It is possible to ascend physically as  Jesus and the other masters demonstrated.  In this process, the physical cells  are all expanded into a higher frequency.  The physical body begins to glow  from within and radiate light.  Much as the blades of a fan seem to "disappear"  as they rotate faster and faster, a body that is vibrating at higher  frequencies seems to disappear from the third dimension. Its primary focus is  on a higher dimension. It seems "magical" to those who remain focused on the  denser third dimension, but it is a perfectly natural process."

    Unfortunately, such promulgators of wisdom do not seem to be able to  demonstrate what they are teaching.  But nobody usually notices that part  because they are too busy having "spiritual experiences" produced by any number  of "techniques" which make them "feel good" long enough to whip out the credit  card or sign the check.  A considerable period of time is required to finally  come to the realization that techniques that relieve stress or produce "good  feelings," have done nothing to actually change their lives or their  "vibrations."  They are still recognized by their neighbor's dog, they still  find new gray hairs on their heads, and they still get sick and have aches and  pains like everyone else.  And they still "die in their sins."

    What the modern day seekers of ascension are looking for - whether they realize  it or not - is the age-old quest.  Those who are not familiar with the  extensive literature don't realize that the Quest for the Holy Grail and the  Great Work of Alchemy are described in almost the same terms.  This means that  the Quest for the Holy Grail and the Work of the Alchemists hold many clues for  us as to the REAL WORK OF ASCENSION.  Repeatedly they present allegories of  struggle, deception, battles with dragons, deceivers, and evil forces of all  kinds.  The story o the Knight who slays the Dragon and rescues the Princess  from the Tower after years of seeking, struggling, suffering and overcoming, is  an allegory that is as valid to day as it was in ages past.  It is the TRUE  PATH OF ASCENSION.

    As we present the information in this volume, the reader will be introduced to  the idea that the science of the ancients may have included a very  comprehensive knowledge of the deeper reality that present day sciences,  including physics, chemistry, mathematics, and astrophysics, are only  rediscovering.  And here we do not mean the ancient Egyptians or Babylonians or  Sumerians, but rather peoples of far greater antiquity than they, and that the  Egyptians, Babylonians, Sumerians, and so on, retained only a distorted and  corrupted version of these things in the form of myths and legends which they  elaborated and utilized in their "magical practices."  Further, we propose that  it is only in the light of the present day scientific knowledge that the true  ancient knowledge, depicted in these myths and legends and religious rites can  be properly understood.  Which is not to say that we are suggesting that we  understand or have interpreted all of them.  We are only saying that there are  many things in these ancient stories that suggest the former existence of an  advanced science, that may have enabled interface between layers, or dimensions  of reality on this planet in archaic times.

    This idea is not original to us, as many readers will know.  However, we do  think that we have been able to shine a light into certain dark corners that  have been, heretofore, poorly understood.  Arthur C. Clarke pointed out, "Any  sufficiently evolved technology is indistinguishable from magic."  

    When we divest our minds of preconceived notions about what the ancients may or  may not have known, and we just look at myths and legends, the substrate of  religions, over and over again we see descriptions of activities, events, terms  and potentials that express such things as a knowledge of free energy, anti- gravity, time travel, interplanetary travel, atomic energy, atomic  molecularization and demolecularization; just a whole host of doings that are  presently understood as the wild and superstitious imaginings of howling  savages.  Today, these concepts are only beginning to be understood.

      Many scholars explain that such stories - myths and legends - were primitive  attempts to understand the environment by personifying, or anthropomorphizing,  the forces of nature.  Other interpreters make the mistake of assuming that it  was a "sacred science" in terms that strictly deny any form of material  interpretation and interpenetration.

    I gave such ideas a great deal of thought at one point, all the while observing  my five children develop, and noting how they noticed things and what they  noticed, and how they explained it to themselves and each other.  One of the  earliest observations I made about children and their reactions to their  environment was that they pretty much just accept it as it is.  They don't seem  to need "explanations" for it.  What is "out there" is what it is until some  adult repeats to them some story about it which may entertain them or frighten  them.  Until "stories" are told to them, children are intensely busy just  imitating what they see other people do, most generally the adults in their  lives.  Without fantastic tales being told to them, their games of make-believe  consist of ordinary mundane and very HUMAN dramas.  And even when they are told  magical stories about flying horses or people with super powers, they often  resist these dramas in preference for those that directly apply to their own  experience and observation.

    Perhaps the comparison of the development of a child's thinking in relation to  their environment, to the development of evolutionary thinking of human beings  in general, is not altogether appropriate, but I do think that it ought to give  us some pause to question just where and how the creation of myth and legend  actually served human beings evolutionarily speaking.  Why would anyone tell a  story about a man with magic sandals that enabled him to fly if they are merely  anthropomorphizing the forces of nature?  If it is a "magical being" such as a  "god," why does he need sandals to fly with?  He could just as easily have  wings that are part of his physical structure.  He's already a god, after all.   He's not human.  So why the sandals?  

    Indeed, there may be an "archetypal pool of ideas" from which all humanity may  draw in dreams and visions, but that leads us into realms that of thought that  do not answer the simple question as to where and how and why howling savages  were served by making up fantastic tales about the forces of nature, that  included certain elements that suggest technology and not a truly "magical  state of being?"

    In the present day, there are all sorts of "mystical" groups and organizations  that claim to be the recipients of ancient knowledge, and that this matter has  to do with what is commonly called "occultism," or the "esoteric" or magical  practices.  There is a plethora of books that purport to be scientific, but  which totally reject mainstream science in any context.  Subjects such as  sacred geometry, archaeoastronomy, new physics, have all become subjects of  fevered study in order to discern the "occult significance" of the works of the  ancients.  And invariably, it is done in strictly ephemeral terms, positing  that all of the abilities of the ancients were accomplished strictly by magical  rites or rituals.  

    Occultists claim that the mental and spiritual powers of the ancients were what  we have lost.  They then assert that this ancient wisdom was broken up and  obscured in magical doctrines which those who are not "initiated" simply cannot  grasp.  They claim that parts of it have been handed down by continuous  tradition, and released to the world at opportune times, and other parts have  only been released to an elect few, of which exalted company, they, of course,  are obviously members.

    When considering such ideas, we do come to the thought that it is very likely  that there are rites or stories or myths behind the rituals, that may, indeed,  have been passed down in such secret groups in a more pure form than the  stories that make their way around the globe across millennia.  But that does  not mean that the "priesthood" of such groups truly understand the stories or  rites of which they are guardians - especially if they do not consider the  possibility that some of such information may be strictly and purely scientific  codes and require a trained scientist to decode them.

    Most of the so-called "occultists" and "sacred geometers" remind me of David  Macaulay's "Motel Of Mysteries,22   Boston, Houghton Mifflin, 1979"a humorous  account of an archaeological excavation of a twentieth century motel, in which  everything is meticulously excavated, recorded and then totally misinterpreted.   The "vast funerary" complex unearthed by Howard Carson contains wonders such  as the "Great Altar" (Television), a statueof the deity WATT (bedside lamp) and  the Internal Component Enclosure (or ICE box).  But just misunderstanding is  not all we have to contend with.  That  there are others who seem to be part of  the very Control System we have mentioned above with what seem to be extremely  dangerous proclivities of promulgating dangerous and cunning lies is also  evident as we will discuss further on.

    In terms of archaeology, there are processes involved in the formation of the  archaeological record.  A lack of understanding of these formation processes is  not always confined to the non-professionals.  It has only relatively recently  been suggested that the archaeology of a site is not a direct record of what  went on there, but instead may have been distorted by a whole series of  processes, including cataclysmic disruption.

    We are suggesting that the same may be true regarding myths and legends and  religious rites.  They are a sort of archaeological record of the history of  mankind held in archetypal terms, buried in stories, distorted by a whole  series of processes.

    Even if some of the purported ancient schools and mystical paths have kept some  of this information intact, or in a purer state, it still seems that much has  "faded on the page" due to the long period of time since such things were part  of the consensus - thus external - reality.  But still, there are those who  have seen the contradictions in our reality and our beliefs and who have sought  in these ancient teachings to discover what might have been known.  Many of  them have made discoveries that, when considered with information from many  other fields, assists us in this essential discovery of our true condition and  purpose.

    The question naturally arises, what does the history of the subject have to  tell us about what may or may not "really work?"  Can we examine it; can we  track it and discover not only the obstacles of the process, but also the REAL  BENEFITS that might accrue to the Seeker?  Can we track and discover the  apparent abilities that are the SIGNS of accomplishment of the successful  Quest?

    In short, what is the REAL Philosophers Stone?  What can the Hero really  accomplish when he finds the Holy Grail?

    One thing Mouravieff wrote that was powerfully meaningful to me was his series  of comments on the "type" of the Knight - who is already well-developed  emotionally, but really needs to work on the intellectual part.  The fact is  this: even though my husband and myself are considered to be "intellectuals"  and to have pursued intellectual development all our lives, what became  excruciatingly clear was that it was very one-sided in some respects.  Because  of what Mouravieff calls the "A" influences - and we just call it the Matrix  Control System - our EMOTIONS were distorted to only allow us to accept ideas  that were emotionally pleasing - even if they were of a high intellectual sort. 

     All of this has to do with what Mouravieff suggests is the "matter of  matters," i.e. "evil."  And that, of course, takes us to the many ideas of  "fixing" the world, or "saving" the world, or whatever.  In other words, what  amounts to hubris - deciding that the ideas that a person has about good and  evil based on human intellectualizations - must be enforced on creation.

    What I finally realized - in a period of intense initiation - was that God has  Many faces - not all of them pleasant to behold.  And, at that point, I SAW the  "Matrix," and I SAW the "A" influences and "B" influences, and that the REAL  work of this level of being is to CHOOSE one's alignment with one or the other,  and then to begin the process of discerning and "assimilating."  This is why  everything is "masked" in symbols.  This reality is, in a sense, the landscape  of the Quest for the Grail.   It is a TEST.  

    But more is needed, as Mouravieff points out.  One must, at some point, DO  something.  And this is where faith comes in.  It is not "faith" in the sense  of a "belief," but Faith in the REALITY of higher things... and it requires the  individual to essentially "step off a cliff" at the edge of the Matrix reality  into the reality of the REAL.  

    I did.

    And just as the alchemists describe it, such an act results in the "death" of  something - and the physical body - so attuned to the "A" influences - being  forcibly disconnected from them via WILL - goes through some of the most  horrible sufferings imaginable.  It could be said to be similar to drug  withdrawal in a sense, but a LOT worse.  In physical terms, an infection took  hold in my body affecting my eyes, ears, and lungs.  I literally wept blood.   For days I lay there, almost unable to breathe, with compresses on my eyes,  medications in my ears, ingesting the massive doses of the most powerful  antibiotics available that had no effect - and I did NOT relent.  I KNEW that  what I was experiencing was the efforts of the "agents of the Matrix" to turn  me aside from my resolve.  And I just kept affirming that "you can kill me if  you like, but I am NOT changing my course."

    And at some point, there was a "shift" and the forces withdrew.

    Ark "found me" 40 days later.  To the day.  

    Now, I have to tell you that this process of being brought to the point of  SEEING was facilitated in a gentle, but firm way by these "Cassiopaeans."  In  fact, looking back over my life in retrospect, I can perceive the influence  from the time of my birth - always there in the background watching over me,  waiting for me to "ask the question."  And when at last, in 1984, I was brought  to that point of bankruptcy - another period of serious illness - the  communication began in a direct way - I would ask the question mentally, and  just wait in a meditative state - and it would begin to flow as just "ideas"  which I would write down.  

    Well, because of the fact that my emotional nature has repeatedly led me into  traps - I already knew that my "machine tolerances" had to be analyzed and  adjusted.  I knew that I had to do research to ensure that what I was  "receiving" was not just more and better disinformation, so to say.

    And so, over the next ten years I did research... and it was during this  research that I came to the idea that, for me to be able to be objective about  things - more of the "adjustment of the machine" - the mode of transmission  really needed to be modified so that the thoughts bypassed my conscious mind.   And so, the two years of developing the circuit for the transmissions via the  board and planchette.  

    Yes, it is unusual.  But for me - knowing my own nature - that of  susceptibility to manipulation because the Love nature in me is so developed    and this energy was so  easily stolen, and manipulated by "agents" - it was a  necessary step.  

    Of course, meeting Ark was an event that was utterly stupendous.  It resulted  in all kinds of "effects" that I try to describe, but words fail.  Some of  these actually included bilocation.  

    Now, lest you think that is a little crazy, I want to point out that Ark is a  30 year career scientist.  At the time he "found me," having been on his own  quest for all his life as well, he had "put away" his dreams and was  functioning as the Director of the Department of Nonlinear Dynamics and Complex  Systems at the Institute for Theoretical Physics, University of Wroclaw,  Poland.  How he dealt with this "activation" of circuits and potentials that  had been suppressed for years is a story in itself.  Some of it is even rather  humorous now, when we look back.  Especially when a man who has convinced  himself that he is a "linear thinker" sees his "other half" come in a window  while she is physically 5,000 miles away.

    At that moment, I had fallen into a spontaneous "trance," so to say - something  that has almost never happened - and I was struggling to maintain my awareness.   I would force my eyes open to observe the environment, and what I saw was  LIVING LIGHT.  Meanwhile, some part of me had apparently decided to take a  little stroll across the Atlantic.

    This occurred several more times during this "readjustment of frequencies"  stage, and was always followed by a baffling period of intense cold where my  teeth would chatter and my body would ache just as if I were freezing.   Thankfully, I found an exact description of this process in the works of Ibn al- 'Arabi, which he calls a "descent."  Based on his description, it is a  temporary "seating" of the higher centers IN THE BODY for the purpose of  "bestowal" of qualities.  I sort of think of it as my higher self as the  "computer hardware repairman" who cam to make some serious adjustments in my  circuitry. Al-'Arabi points out that when the "angel," as he calls it,  withdraws, the individual, having been in a "state" of super-accelerated  vibration - which manifests as heat (and boy, was it HOT!) - then feels the  normal condition as intensely cold and cannot get warm by any human means and  must simply wait for the vibrations of the body to catch up with the vibrations  of the newly bestowed "station."  

    I was very relieved to read this.  And again, it was exactly right for me to  read it AFTER experiencing it so that I would not doubt my experience and think  that I had "manifested" it due to emotional thinking.

    This is also why it was exactly right, after going through the past year of  "trial by fire" that Mouravieff should become the new piece of the puzzle -  only AFTER the experiences he describes.  This is what convinces me of the fact  that he has brought to us a major piece of the puzzle.  There is NO possibility  that anything that has occurred in the past years was "suggested" to me by  reading his material beforehand, and the events are described by him in detail -  exactly as they happened.  In short, it further strengthens my HOPE that we  CAN "DO" something.  And I must say that, like you, I was losing my hope in the  course of the seemingly endless struggle.

    Because, of course, our struggle has been enormous, probably based on the fact  that we have "gone public" and have made some significant ripples in the  "Matrix."  And frankly, I do NOT think that anyone could do it without a  "living Tradition" such as the C's - because we always have guidance - even if  sometimes it is rather cryptic due to the non-violation of learning directive.   If not for their assurances that this relentless attack was the "fire" from  which would come "light," we would have just given up any public work at all.   The attacks, the liars and defamers, spreaders of "scandal" and odious and  sickening acts of purely filthy libel - attacks on our children even - were  utterly horrendous.  

    But we survived, we passed that test, daily turning the negative emotions into  "light" and giving it out to the world.  

    And Mouravieff was the "gift" that came after.

    And what a gift it is.

    Oh, indeed.  But now, perhaps, you know better what we have done so far... you  start with faith that there IS Truth "out there."  You evaluate your own being  and determine how best to find out what is or is not truth - that's research -  after a period of that, which is the "collecting of "A" influences," as well as  a repeated series of shocks when you discover that what you may have believed  as true is NOT true... this begins to "fuse" the magnetic center.  

    After a period of that, once you get down to some of the most fundamental lies  in which you believed, and you are mightily shocked to have to make the choice  to give them up, or go back to sleep in the lies. 

     THEN you realize that Truth leads to action.  This action results in another  major shock - and that takes you over into a sort of "space" that is sort of an  "interval."  Hopefully, you have enough will to sustain yourself there... and  if so, you land on the next "note" which is essentially, a different "world."   And in THAT world, polar beings find each other.  And in that world, you find  hope.

    But again, hope is nurtured by knowledge - by research... and so, at this new  level of being, you continue... 

    And there we are.  And now, we see more light at the end of the tunnel.  That  hope is growing.
