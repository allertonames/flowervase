On a previous HJ I could see or feel I was in a figurative womb, I felt like a unborn fetus in the dreaming world. I had no physical connection only by mind. It wasa  testing ground like th eroad of trials and depending on who I first lost my virginity to made an outcome to the gender. Sex the person the fetus could be born into. 
Or what ever the test may be how I acted in that test had knock on effects for the next life – perhaps even echos into the previous that I could change that life and alter the course of this one. 


This journey was thailand just a threshold and Cambodia I was swlallowed into a bigger monster. 
The Disco dance hall explained in Steppenwolf –  They call it All gods Creatures – They know they are part of a larger whole eco system – like the bird who with some effort will always have food just on the scraps others waste, the human will be provided for their needs covered its’ easier the closer to their universal path they are. 
The mind meld of agreement, which boils down to basic instincts, unfortunalty for me it’s survival If I join in I might be trapped stuck, sold into  a form of slavery to this monster. For others who have trust in their frineds and family its a basic insticnt of procreation – fucking. It helps them get laid. 

Being next to the sea makes it easier for the sea creatures to be in the mind meld, I felt the whale like mind when I smoke weed – it gives me teleapthy into the AGC group and I’m still learning the significance and consequnces. It felt like a whale had invisibly desended and was sat on top of me and it swallowed Star and Eiren as part of the AGC group.
Ladies of the group can see I’m a part of it but the look of confusion on my face when I don’t participate leaves them frustrated. I continue to wet talk – either forgotten or unaware of the  need to suck it in and dry mouth. A dry mouth shows your not an automatic. But a wet talker not following automatic cues is even more confusing.

"The idea that the passage of the magical threshold is a transit into a sphere of rebirth is symbolized in the worldwide womb image of the belly of the whale. The hero, instead of conquering or conciliating the power of the threshold, is swallowed into the unknown and would appear to have died" 
-- (Campbell 90) 
"This popular motif gives emphasis to the lesson that the passage of the threshold is a form of self-annihilation. . .[I]nstead of passing outward, beyond the confines of the visible world, the hero goes inward, to be born again. The disappearance corresponds to the passing of a worshiper into a temple - where he is to be quickened by the recollection of who and what he is, namely dust and ashes unless immortal. The temple interior, the belly of the whale, and the heavenly land beyond, above, and below the confines of the world, are one and the same. That is why the approaches and entrances to temples are flanked and defended by colossal gargoyles: dragons, lions, devil-slayers with drawn swords, resentful dwarfs, winged bulls. These are the threshold guardians to ward away all incapable of encountering the higher silences within. . .The devotee at the moment of entry into a temple undergoes a metamorphosis. His secular character remains without; he sheds it, as a snake its slough. Once inside he may be said to have died to time and returned to the World Womb, the World Navel, the Earthly Paradise. . .Allegorically, then, the passage into a temple and the hero-dive through the jaws of the whale are identical adventures, both demoting in picture language, the life-centering, life renewing act" 
-- (Campbell 91-92)
