We can project our reality on to others but it is reflected back at us. A female friend was complaining about an acquaintance down the pub, how she thought he was a bit of a fool, a bit thick – in her opinion! I mentioned that he might be the cleverest person she knows but if she projects onto him that she views him as the village idiot – then that’s all he will ever be to you.

there seems to be limts' you then have to maintain their reality to maintain yours
And it shows that you can only create your own reality to a certain extent, 

Ruling class, intra species parasite, illuminati whatever, might think they are better but to be in an alternative dimension they have to maintain whatever they are parasiting on what they consider as reality. that's why we are probably in a matrix, and if the world does end our reality will continue but we will fractally experience a rough ride,
