Just had a conversation with a Aussie, who is so deep in the propaganda soup he actually believes the official 9/11 story 
Parroted the official media narrative, he wouldn't believe facts I presented cos I didn't actually have the FBI report in my hands.
He asked what I did in Chiang Mai I said a writer with no hesitation. He had a long pause processing what he thought was  bull shit info might actually have some merit.
I saw the confusion his eyes as he processed conflicting information. He got uncomfortable like a child when caught lying.
There was a docu on TD the propaganda game about a man goes into north Korea to document normal life. He was on a similar level of indoctrination as the north Koreans. Unless it was sanctioned news sources it was a crackpot website.
Somehow we got onto gov and her called me anarchist, he had difficulty explaining what it meant other than chaos.
He finally went quiet, had a  thousand yard stare after he agreed Iraq war was based on a lie, and agreed us had done Iran-Contra and supplied the mujahedeen and I said they probably did the same or similar to Libya, Syria etc.
After he said Putin was a dictator and evil I said he was elected so not a dictator. Your facts are wrong. I even called him a imbecile at one point which he didn't answer.
Near the end when he was trying to ignore me by playing with his phone. He muttered something like, oh I woke up, Freudian slip I think that he actually had an original thought.
Nearly all his arguments against whatever were fallacies, all could be turned back, reflected on his position.
