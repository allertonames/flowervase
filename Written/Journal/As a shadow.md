First notes 
at the 4 nodal points of the year xmas & summer being the main the shadow returns to the material to check on their human.
The shadow will incarnate as a reflection of how the human was last time, A literal shadow of a former self - the self of 6 months ago  they check on the goals and targets that were set on the last visit. 
problem is the shadow is as you'd expect dark and the targets can be continued alcoholism, drug use - hiv.
the shadow live in the immaterial and don't know what's been going in the time between. there is  no time there but 6 months have passed here. 

Hero journey billy was a good kid until he met his dark shadow - the shadow had bought him at the meat skin market 

reply with yes your a biological robot in a meaningless universe - leave it at that   ahh that's it if they shadow gets the robot response they know they can further the entrainment. 
Certain Questions to establish control - the more the robot resides in the material the more the shadow can entrain - knowledge of magic and control mechanisms means shadow gives up.

Go through the HJ call testing atonement etc. 
Bad shadow and took delight in turning out what most parents would call the wrong sort. the key was to break the free will and get them doing things the shadow enjoyed doing - stealing, drinking, dirty sex, drugs etc etc the more they do them the further down the spiral of control (need a name) and harder to climb out. 

2nd Notes

as a shadow of my former SElf.
I lost my first self and had to piggy back onto others

Wounded child before 7 is easy prey for shadow archons - they spin and twist them out the free will is very very weak
in their dreams they are degraded into foul obscene things no loving parents to protect them

up to age 7 ish easy after that to Soul body settle down a bit and the free will steels itself.

My first self was a wounded child but eventually he embodied a soul from the previous civilisation from mars - we can deal with atlantis souls easily now just confuse them with xxxxxx
but interplanetary with that indigo glow sickened the bad archons that why I got him cheap wounded used and abused and now indiglow bargain

I was having a whale of a time - as a dolphin a bear a elephant lifetime after lifetime inorganic was  a good one.

Steer him towards some magic occult stuff and it would purge the worse of the helpless feelings caused by the loose first 7 years of torment both in the dreaming by the archons and those few times the bad woman would fiddle with him and tell him he was a bad boy and be ashamed 

but the adopted parents in their blinkered wisdom thought they knew better had to stop the interest in earth energies - in wisdom and rely on the good book 
Like most others they stuffed the bible down throat - but this is the main trick of the archons they have the parents in the cave and parents want to keep the child in the same cave with the fool's gold chains 
If that didn't work they had to rely on backup books 
HÃ¡lsar 
Dictionary
not long before a ipad is used then they will truely believe even in death they are biological robots in a meaning less universe

I lost that one afer he joined the church - parents puched him there afer the intrest in magic but I still reetained the higher self 
Kept tellling him the truth on matters 
really tried to show beyond a doubt the immmaterial was a place he could control but all the while his conditoning by the archons told him other wisse
I suppose it was a bit much and I should have doneit oni stages to tell him he was more divine than Jehovah the creator of this world the false world.

become like go whne he was so wounded he thought his frineds and family were better off without him - not having to put up with is excentricities 
not worthy - those imprints form a wounded child are hard to shift. 

Ok so put him on a huge fall 
and follow the path of the hero a good solid rehabilitaion methods
If he survuives th afall and the darkest of darkest night - the muscle tension memeory could survuvie even jehovah testing his spirit.
