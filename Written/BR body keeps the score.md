The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma - Bessel van der Kolk MD (Highlight: 65; Note: 0)

"Traumatized people are often afraid of feeling. "

"It’s not surprising that so many trauma survivors are compulsive eaters and drinkers, fear making love, and avoid many social activities: Their sensory world is largely off limits."

"Shame plays an important role in this: “You will find out how rotten and disgusting I am and dump me as soon as you really get to know me.” Unresolved trauma can take a terrible toll on relationships."
(Chapter:CONTENTS)

"For real change to take place, the body needs to learn that the danger has passed and to live in the reality of the present"
(Chapter:1. LESSONS FROM VIETNAM VETERANS)

"You can be fully in charge of your life only if you can acknowledge the reality of your body, in all its visceral dimensions."

"The mere opportunity to escape does not necessarily make traumatized animals, or people, take the road to freedom. Like Maier and Seligman’s dogs, many traumatized people simply give up. Rather than risk experimenting with new options they stay stuck in the fear they know."
(Chapter:2. REVOLUTIONS IN UNDERSTANDING MIND AND BRAIN)

"All trauma is preverbal. Shakespeare captures this state of speechless terror in Macbeth, after the murdered king’s body is discovered: “Oh horror! horror! horror! Tongue nor heart cannot conceive nor name thee! Confusion now hath made his masterpiece!” Under extreme conditions people may scream obscenities, call for their mothers, howl in terror, or simply shut down. "
(Chapter:3. LOOKING INTO THE BRAIN: THE NEUROSCIENCE REVOLUTION)

Chapter 4
"When the old brain takes over, it partially shuts down the higher brain, our conscious mind, and propels the body to run, hide, fight, or, on occasion, freeze. "

"Faced with danger people automatically secrete stress hormones to fuel resistance and escape. Brain and body are programmed to run for home, where safety can be restored and stress hormones can come to rest"

"The brain is built from the bottom up. It develops level by level within every child in the womb, just as it did in the course of evolution. The most primitive part, the part that is already online when we are born, is the ancient animal brain, often called the reptilian brain."

"Right above the reptilian brain is the limbic system. It’s also known as the mammalian brain, because all animals that live in groups and nurture their young possess one. Development of this part of the brain truly takes off after a baby is born. It is the seat of the emotions, the monitor of danger, the judge of what is pleasurable or scary, the arbiter of what is or is not important for survival purposes. It is also a central command post for coping with the challenges of living within our complex social networks."

"If you feel safe and loved, your brain becomes specialized in exploration, play, and cooperation; if you are frightened and unwanted, it specializes in managing feelings of fear and abandonment."

"Trauma almost invariably involves not being seen, not being mirrored, and not being taken into account. Treatment needs to reactivate the capacity to safely mirror, and be mirrored, by others, but also to resist being hijacked by others’ negative emotions."

"Without flexible, active frontal lobes people become creatures of habit, and their relationships become superficial and routine. "

"trauma increases the risk of misinterpreting whether a particular situation is dangerous or safe."
(Chapter:4. RUNNING FOR YOUR LIFE: THE ANATOMY OF SURVIVAL)

Chapter 6
"Over the years our research team has repeatedly found that chronic emotional abuse and neglect can be just as devastating as physical abuse and sexual molestation"

"alexithymics substitute the language of action for that of emotion. When asked, “How would you feel if you saw a truck coming at you at eighty miles per hour?” most people would say, “I’d be terrified” or “I’d be frozen with fear.” An alexithymic might reply, “How would I feel? I don’t know. . . . I’d get out of the way.”18 "

"The prefrontal cortex (PFC) normally helps us to assess the person coming toward us, and our mirror neurons help to pick up his intentions. However, the subjects with PTSD did not activate any part of their frontal lobe, which means they could not muster any curiosity about the stranger. They just reacted with intense activation deep inside their emotional brains, in the primitive areas known as the Periaqueductal Gray, which generates startle, hypervigilance, cowering, and other self-protective behaviors. There was no activation of any part of the brain involved in social engagement. In response to being looked at they simply went into survival mode."
(Chapter:6. LOSING YOUR BODY, LOSING YOUR SELF)



Chapter 7 
"If a mother cannot meet her baby’s impulses and needs, “the baby learns to become the mother’s idea of what the baby is.” Having to discount its inner sensations, and trying to adjust to its caregiver’s needs, means the child perceives that “something is wrong” with the way it is. Children who lack physical attunement are vulnerable to shutting down the direct feedback from their bodies, the seat of pleasure, purpose, and direction."

"If you have no internal sense of security, it is difficult to distinguish between safety and danger. If you feel chronically numbed out, potentially dangerous situations may make you feel alive. If you conclude that you must be a terrible person (because why else would your parents have you treated that way?), you start expecting other people to treat you horribly. You probably deserve it, and anyway, there is nothing you can do about it. When disorganized people carry self-perceptions like these, they are set up to be traumatized by subsequent experiences."

"unstable sense of self, self-damaging impulsivity (including excessive spending, promiscuous sex, substance abuse, reckless driving, and binge eating), inappropriate and intense anger, and recurrent suicidal behavior."

"Dissociation means simultaneously knowing and not knowing.  Bowlby wrote: “What cannot be communicated to the [m]other cannot be communicated to the self.”  If you cannot tolerate what you know or feel what you feel, the only option is denial and dissociation.  Maybe the most devastating long-term effect of this shutdown is not feeling real inside,"

"The critical underlying issue was that these patients didn’t know how to feel safe. Lack of safety within the early caregiving relationship led to an impaired sense of inner reality, excessive clinging, and self-damaging behavior: "
(Chapter:7. GETTING ON THE SAME WAVELENGTH: ATTACHMENT AND ATTUNEMENT)

"the moment we feel trapped, enraged, or rejected, we are vulnerable to activating old maps and to follow their directions. Change begins when we learn to “own” our emotional brains. That means learning to observe and tolerate the heartbreaking and gut-wrenching sensations that register misery and humiliation. Only after learning to bear what is going on inside can we start to befriend, rather than obliterate, the emotions that keep our maps fixed and immutable."
(Chapter:8. TRAPPED IN RELATIONSHIPS: THE COST OF ABUSE AND NEGLECT)

"The adults who had been abused as children often had trouble concentrating, complained of always being on edge, and were filled with self-loathing. They had enormous trouble negotiating intimate relationships, often veering from indiscriminate, high-risk, and unsatisfying sexual involvements to total sexual shutdown. They also had large gaps in their memories, often engaged in self-destructive behaviors, and had a host of medical problems"
(Chapter:9. WHAT’S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT?)

"they were shocked to discover that most of their morbidly obese patients had been sexually abused as children. They also uncovered a host of other family problems."
(Chapter:9. WHAT’S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT?)

"The conclusion is clear: Children who are fortunate enough to have an attuned and attentive parent are not going to develop this genetically related problem."
(Chapter:10. DEVELOPMENTAL TRAUMA: THE HIDDEN EPIDEMIC)

"He later wrote that when patients dissociate their traumatic experience, they become “attached to an insurmountable obstacle”: “[U]nable to integrate their traumatic memories, they seem to lose their capacity to assimilate new experiences as well. It is . . . as if their personality has definitely stopped at a certain point, and cannot enlarge any more by the addition or assimilation of new elements.”"
(Chapter:11. UNCOVERING SECRETS: THE PROBLEM OF TRAUMATIC MEMORY)

"that unless they became aware of the split-off elements and integrated them into a story that had happened in the past but was now over, they would experience a slow decline in their personal and professional functioning"
(Chapter:11. UNCOVERING SECRETS: THE PROBLEM OF TRAUMATIC MEMORY)

"people with PTSD are unable to put the actual event, the source of those memories, behind them. Dissociation prevents the trauma from becoming integrated within the conglomerated, ever-shifting stores of autobiographical memory, in essence creating a dual memory system"
(Chapter:11. UNCOVERING SECRETS: THE PROBLEM OF TRAUMATIC MEMORY)

"involves (1) finding a way to become calm and focused, (2) learning to maintain that calm in response to images, thoughts, sounds, or physical sensations that remind you of the past, (3) finding a way to be fully alive in the present and engaged with the people around you, (4) not having to keep secrets from yourself, including secrets about the ways that you have managed to survive."
(Chapter:13. HEALING FROM TRAUMA: OWNING YOUR SELF)

"In contrast with the rational brain, which expresses itself in thoughts, the emotional brain manifests itself in physical reactions: gut-wrenching sensations, heart pounding, breathing becoming fast and shallow, feelings of heartbreak, speaking with an uptight and reedy voice, and the characteristic body movements that signify collapse, rigidity, rage, or defensiveness."
(Chapter:13. HEALING FROM TRAUMA: OWNING YOUR SELF)

"Traumatized people are often afraid of feeling. It is not so much the perpetrators (who, hopefully, are no longer around to hurt them) but their own physical sensations that now are the enemy. Apprehension about being hijacked by uncomfortable sensations keeps the body frozen and the mind shut. Even though the trauma is a thing of the past, the emotional brain keeps generating sensations that make the sufferer feel scared and helpless."
(Chapter:13. HEALING FROM TRAUMA: OWNING YOUR SELF)

"the promise of closeness often evokes fear of getting hurt, betrayed, and abandoned. Shame plays an important role in this: “You will find out how rotten and disgusting I am and dump me as soon as you really get to know me.”"
(Chapter:13. HEALING FROM TRAUMA: OWNING YOUR SELF)

"You have to find someone you can trust enough to accompany you, someone who can safely hold your feelings and help you listen to the painful messages from your emotional brain. You need a guide who is not afraid of your terror and who can contain your darkest rage, someone who can safeguard the wholeness of you while you explore the fragmented experiences that you had to keep secret from yourself for so long. Most traumatized individuals need an anchor and a great deal of coaching to do this work."
(Chapter:13. HEALING FROM TRAUMA: OWNING YOUR SELF)

"The critical question is this: Do you feel that your therapist is curious to find out who you are and what you, not some generic “PTSD patient,” need?"
(Chapter:13. HEALING FROM TRAUMA: OWNING YOUR SELF)

"When people are forced to submit to overwhelming power, as is true for most abused children, women trapped in domestic violence, and incarcerated men and women, they often survive with resigned compliance. "
(Chapter:13. HEALING FROM TRAUMA: OWNING YOUR SELF)

"People cannot put traumatic events behind until they are able to acknowledge what has happened and start to recognize the invisible demons they’re struggling with."
(Chapter:13. HEALING FROM TRAUMA: OWNING YOUR SELF)

"Drugs cannot “cure” trauma; they can only dampen the expressions of a disturbed physiology. "
(Chapter:13. HEALING FROM TRAUMA: OWNING YOUR SELF)

"Traumatized patients tend to like tranquilizing drugs, benzodiazepines like Klonopin, Valium, Xanax, and Ativan. In many ways, they work like alcohol, in that they make people feel calm and keep them from worrying. (Casino owners love customers on benzodiazepines; they don’t get upset when they lose and keep gambling.) But also, like alcohol, benzos weaken inhibitions against saying hurtful things to people we love. Most civilian doctors are reluctant to prescribe these drugs, because they have a high addiction potential and they may also interfere with trauma processing. Patients who stop taking them after prolonged use usually have withdrawal reactions that make them agitated and increase posttraumatic symptoms."
(Chapter:13. HEALING FROM TRAUMA: OWNING YOUR SELF)

"John Bowlby so memorably put it: “What can not be spoken to the [m]other cannot be told to the self.”"
(Chapter:14. LANGUAGE: MIRACLE AND TYRANNY)

"Once people started to integrate their traumatic memories, they spontaneously continued to improve. In contrast, all those who had taken Prozac relapsed when they went off the drug."
(Chapter:15. LETTING GO OF THE PAST: EMDR)

"People who are this scared can’t think straight, and any demand to perform will only make them shut down further."
(Chapter:16. LEARNING TO INHABIT YOUR BODY: YOGA)

"Her smoke detector, her amygdala, had been rewired to interpret certain situations as harbingers of life-threatening danger, and it was sending urgent signals to her survival brain to fight, freeze, or flee. Annie had all these reactions simultaneously—she was visibly agitated and mentally shut down."
(Chapter:16. LEARNING TO INHABIT YOUR BODY: YOGA)

"One of the ways the memory of helplessness is stored is as muscle tension or feelings of disintegration in the affected body areas: head, back, and limbs in accident victims, vagina and rectum in victims of sexual abuse. The lives of many trauma survivors come to revolve around bracing against and neutralizing unwanted sensory experiences, and most people I see in my practice have become experts in such self-numbing. They may become serially obese or anorexic or addicted to exercise or work. At least half of all traumatized people try to dull their intolerable inner world with drugs or alcohol. The flip side of numbing is sensation seeking. Many people cut themselves to make the numbing go away, while others try bungee jumping or high-risk activities like prostitution and gambling. Any of these methods can give them a false and paradoxical feeling of control"
(Chapter:16. LEARNING TO INHABIT YOUR BODY: YOGA)

"It is much more productive to see aggression or depression, arrogance or passivity as learned behaviors: Somewhere along the line, the patient came to believe that he or she could survive only if he or she was tough, invisible, or absent, or that it was safer to give up. "
(Chapter:17. PUTTING THE PIECES TOGETHER: SELF-LEADERSHIP)

"abused children are likely to grow up believing that they are fundamentally unlovable; that was the only way their young minds could explain why they were treated so badly. They survive by denying, ignoring, and splitting off large chunks of reality: They forget the abuse; they suppress their rage or despair; they numb their physical sensations. If you were abused as a child, you are likely to have a childlike part living inside you that is frozen in time, still holding fast to this kind of self-loathing and denial."
(Chapter:17. PUTTING THE PIECES TOGETHER: SELF-LEADERSHIP)  Also see Kalshed 

"Beneath the surface of the protective parts of trauma survivors there exists an undamaged essence, a Self that is confident, curious, and calm, a Self that has been sheltered from destruction by the various protectors that have emerged in their efforts to ensure survival. Once those protectors trust that it is safe to separate, the Self will spontaneously emerge, and the parts can be enlisted in the healing process."
(Chapter:17. PUTTING THE PIECES TOGETHER: SELF-LEADERSHIP)

"Firefighters are frantic, and if you ask them what would happen if they stopped doing their job, you discover that they believe the exiled feelings would crash the entire self-system. They are also oblivious to the idea that there are better ways to guarantee physical and emotional safety, and even if behaviors like bingeing or cutting stop, firefighters often find other methods of self-harm. These cycles will come to an end only when the Self is able to take charge and the system feels safe."
(Chapter:17. PUTTING THE PIECES TOGETHER: SELF-LEADERSHIP)

"Keeping the exiles locked up, however, stamps out not only memories and emotions but also the parts that hold them—the parts that were hurt the most by the trauma. In Schwartz’s words: “Usually those are your most sensitive, creative, intimacy-loving, lively, playful and innocent parts. By exiling them when they get hurt, they suffer a double whammy—the insult of your rejection is added to their original injury.”
(Chapter:17. PUTTING THE PIECES TOGETHER: SELF-LEADERSHIP)

" As long as their map of the world is based on trauma, abuse, and neglect, people are likely to seek shortcuts to oblivion. Anticipating rejection, ridicule, and deprivation, they are reluctant to try out new options, certain that these will lead to failure. This lack of experimentation traps people in a matrix of fear, isolation, and scarcity where it is impossible to welcome the very experiences that might change their basic worldview."
(Chapter:18. FILLING IN THE HOLES: CREATING STRUCTURES)

"Most people are hesitant to go into past pain and disappointment—it only promises to bring back the intolerable. But as they are mirrored and witnessed, a new reality begins to take shape. Accurate mirroring feels completely different from being ignored, criticized, and put down. It gives you permission to feel what you feel and know what you know—one of the essential foundations of recovery."
(Chapter:18. FILLING IN THE HOLES: CREATING STRUCTURES)

"In order to change, people need to become viscerally familiar with realities that directly contradict the static feelings of the frozen or panicked self of trauma, replacing them with sensations rooted in safety, mastery, delight, and connection. As we saw in the chapter on EMDR, one of the functions of dreaming is to create associations in which the frustrating events of the day are interwoven with the rest of one’s life."
(Chapter:18. FILLING IN THE HOLES: CREATING STRUCTURES)

"Everything is about using the whole body and having other bodies resonate with your feelings, emotions and thoughts.”"
(Chapter:20. FINDING YOUR VOICE: COMMUNAL RHYTHMS AND THEATER)

"Traumatized people are afraid of conflict. They fear losing control and ending up on the losing side once again. Conflict is central to theater—inner conflicts, interpersonal conflicts, family conflicts, social conflicts, and their consequences. Trauma is about trying to forget, hiding how scared, enraged, or helpless you are. Theater is about finding ways of telling the truth and conveying deep truths to your audience"
(Chapter:20. FINDING YOUR VOICE: COMMUNAL RHYTHMS AND THEATER)

"Life is upside down,” he means that if you treat kids who've suffered abuse with love or generosity, they often don’t know what to make of it or how to respond. Rudeness feels more familiar; cynicism they understand."
(Chapter:20. FINDING YOUR VOICE: COMMUNAL RHYTHMS AND THEATER)

"Trauma breeds further trauma; hurt people hurt other people."
(Chapter:EPILOGUE: CHOICES TO BE MADE)

"abused and neglected students are likely to interpret any deviation from routine as danger and that their extreme reactions usually are expressions of traumatic stress. Children who defy the rules are unlikely to be brought to reason by verbal reprimands or even suspension"
(Chapter:EPILOGUE: CHOICES TO BE MADE)

"perspectives begin to change when they realize that these kids’ disturbing behaviors started out as frustrated attempts to communicate distress and as misguided attempts to survive."
(Chapter:EPILOGUE: CHOICES TO BE MADE)

"identifying the truth of an experience is essential to healing from trauma."
(Chapter:EPILOGUE: CHOICES TO BE MADE)

"being in control of ourselves requires becoming familiar with our inner world and accurately identifying what scares, upsets, or delights us."

"Last year I spent three weeks helping two boys prepare a scene from Julius Caesar. An effeminate, shy boy was playing Brutus and had to summon up his full force to put down Cassius, played by the class bully, who had to be coached to play a corrupt general begging for mercy. The scene came to life only after the bully talked about his father’s violence and his own vow never to show weakness to anyone. (Most bullies have themselves been bullied, and they despise kids who remind them of their own vulnerability.) Brutus’s powerful voice, on the other hand, emerged after he realized that he’d made himself invisible to deal with his own family violence."

From a blog
Childhood complex trauma survivors, often have a very hurt inner child, that continues on to affect the survivor in adulthood. When a child’s emotional needs are not met and a child is repeatedly hurt and abused, this deeply and profoundly affects the child’s development. A survivor will often continue on subconsciously wanting those unmet childhood needs – in adulthood. Looking for safety, protection, being cherished, and loved, can often be normal needs in childhood, that were not met, and the survivor searches for these in other adults. This can be where survivors search for mother and father figures. Transference issues in counselling can occur and this is normal for childhood abuse survivo
