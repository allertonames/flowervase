Climb the greatest mountain. Achieve all the accolades in the world. Become
the greatest in your field. Achieve fame. Earn millions.

And you will enjoy every bit of the journey, if and only if you understand that none of it means anything.
When something has meaning, it becomes work. When something is meaningless, it becomes play. The joy that you experience in honing your craft is the greatest reward. Spending your life exactly the way you wish to spend it is a wonderful liberation. This is what sinks into the heart. This is the true experience. And understand this: life’s nectar lies in experience, rather than reward. Rewards fade from memory. Experiences remain forever.
A life of wild abandon is the greatest life. Leave purpose to the wind. Give yourself to your life. Surrender yourself to your inspirations. Achieve all the greatness in the world. And be willing to drop it without hesitation.
This is a life of joy.
This is a life of freedom.

Name or body, which is dearer?
Body or wealth, which is more?
Gain or loss, which is worse?
Excessive desire is certainly a great expense,
Much hoarding is certainly a severe loss.
Knowing what is enough, there is no disappointment,
Knowing when to stop, there is no danger.
Thus, one can endure forever.
 (p. 398).

In the olden days, the majority of higher-level Daoists did not walk around wearing fancy clothes of a special cut and with a high hat, as hotshot Confucians, ceremonial Daoists, or Buddhists commonly did. Rather the ones who were generally known as being really high-powered people would often appear dressed in simple clothes, maybe even rags with holes in them. They did not care if they looked poor, average, or even below average. This was simply because they did not want to be bothered and did not feel they had any face to lose or gain.

(pp. 302-303).

Daoists commonly say, “If words do not serve you, it is better you do not use them.”

Great Dao neglected,
There emerges benevolence and righteousness.
Learning and erudition professed,
There emerges great artifice.
The six elements of kinship are not in harmony,
There emerges family duty (filial piety) and devotion.
The nation disordered and in upheaval,
There emerge patriotic ministers.

(The Complete Daodejing Book 1) (p. 368).

What does it mean to behave like melting ice? It means to continuously let go of your ego’s solidity. Forget about the heat that agitates the molecules, just think about when an ice cube melts. It lets go of its form, as it goes from being solid to being liquid. Similarly, as best as you can, yield to both what is inside of you and situations outside of you. If you think that there is something you can do about it and you can affect it, fine. 
Otherwise, if you cannot, just yield to the inevitable.

In cultivating your soul and vitality to Embrace the One,
Can you avoid separation?
In gathering your breath to become soft,
Can you be like an infant child?
In cleansing and polishing your profound perception,
Can you be without blemish?
In loving the people and governing the kingdom,
Can you be without cleverness? (Can you be wuwei/without action?)
In opening and closing the Gate of Heaven,
Can you be feminine?
In illuminating clarity to penetrate the four directions,
Can you be effortless (wuwei)?
Give life to things, nurture things,
Give life, but do not possess,
Act, but do not take credit,
Lead, but do not dominate.
This is called the Mysterious Dao

(p. 193).

Chapter 6
The Valley Spirit never dies,
It is called the Mysterious Female.
The Mysterious Female,
Its gate is called the origin of Heaven and Earth.
Perpetually continuing, always endures,
Its use is effortless.

(p. 126).

The Master doesn't try to be powerful;
thus he is truly powerful.
The ordinary man keeps reaching for power;
thus he never has enough.

The Master does nothing,
yet he leaves nothing undone.
The ordinary man is always doing things,
yet many more are left to be done.

The kind man does something,
yet something remains undone.
The just man does something,
and leaves many things to be done.
The moral man does something,
and when no one responds
he rolls up his sleeves and uses force.

When the Tao is lost, there is goodness.
When goodness is lost, there is morality.
When morality is lost, there is ritual.
Ritual is the husk of true faith,
the beginning of chaos.

Therefore the Master concerns himself
with the depths and not the surface,
with the fruit and not the flower.
He has no will of his own.
He dwells in reality,
and lets all illusions go.

As the continuum continues, what will count will not be the specifics of exactly what you do or do not do. Those will be lost in the sands of time and the changes that will never cease. Rather, what will count will be the state of mind and the awareness you engaged when you exercised or did not exercise sincerity.

(p. 166). 

---
Chapter 7
Heaven constant, Earth permanent,
Heaven and Earth, the reason they can be constant and permanent is because they do not exist for themselves,
Hence they exist forever.
Thus, the sage places himself behind, but finds himself in front,
Excludes himself, and the self is preserved,
Is this not because he has no self-interest?
Therefore, the self can be fulfilled.

(p. 137). 

 ---
What Daoists see as a true act of humility is simply to recognize that you do not know what you do not know; and to recognize that there are things you cannot know while recognizing what can be known. It is great that lots of things can be known, but there is a lot that cannot be known. Humility recognizes the difference.

(p. 144).

Benevolence and righteousness are basic Confucian ideas and, in a cheeky way, are mostly refuted by all the lines of this chapter. Likewise, from learning and erudition, there emerges great artifice. In one sense, this is descriptive of what some lawyers do in modern times. They often pervert the spirit of law and Dao, and then skillfully work out the words that are necessary to implement their goals. Artifice, trickery, using intelligence to manipulate viewpoints, making things appear to be what they are not – all of that is done to shift one set of words for another, and to shift all the emotional, mental, and psychic meanings that are attached to those words.

(The Complete Daodejing Book 1) (p. 370).

Chapter 19
 Abandon sageliness, discard erudition,
The people will benefit a hundredfold.
Abandon benevolence, discard righteousness,
The people will return to devotion (filial piety) and affection.
Abandon craftiness, discard profit,
Thieves and robbers will disappear.
These three cultural conventions are not enough.
Therefore, let the people follow these:
Recognize simplicity, embrace purity,
Reduce self-centeredness, diminish desires.

(The Complete Daodejing Book 1) (p. 389).

Daoists say it is good to dispassionately recognize the different parts of ourselves. This is so that you can dissolve the different parts of yourself which are essentially problematic, and which lead you away from the Dao and toward being dominated by the Mind of Man. It is not only political advice. Laozi is absolutely proposing that, if needed, all these parts within ourselves have to be negotiated and resolved through Emptiness, otherwise your essence will forever elude you.

(The Complete Daodejing Book 1) (p. 388).

Chapter 15 
The ancient masters who excelled in practice were those who were subtle, spiritual, mysterious, and penetrating,
So profound it cannot be understood,
Truly for this reason, they cannot be known.
Therefore, we try to describe their demeanor:
Deliberate in action, like crossing a winter stream.
Oh, vigilant! Like being alert to the four directions,
Oh, courteous! Like a guest,
Oh, yielding! Like ice beginning to melt,
Oh, simple! Like uncarved wood,
Oh, open! Like a valley,
Oh, opaque! Like murky water.
Who can make the murky water, by stillness, gradually become clear?
Who can make the inert, by long-lasting movement, gradually become alive?
Those who embrace the Dao do not seek excess,
Because they are not in excess.
Therefore, they can grow old without needing to be restored to perfection.

(p. 299).

“The teacher takes you to the gate.” That means they teach you what it is and what to do until, through practice, you arrive at its reality. The line continues, “…but only you can walk through it”; that is, success and abilities come from your own effort, your own heart and mind working through the material, from beginning to the end, and thereby resolving any confusion you might have had about any implications. The Buddha gave similar advice. An individual has to go through the work of peeling back the layers. Unlike information, wisdom cannot be bought; it must be earned.

(p. 290).  

 ---
What we call “I” or “me,” whatever that is, could be just a way for your mind to gel coherently together for communication purposes. As the ten thousand identities unify into a single, coherent face, it gives a person a very solid sense of “This is who I am.” In truth, many of the identities are just conglomerations of extrapolations and memories. They are not actually what the person is, nor even necessarily what the person deep down thinks about themselves. But Daoists are very clear that your personal essence or the essence of any human being is beyond conscious thinking. It is beyond what you think about yourself, and even beyond that ground from which the ability to think about yourself derives.

(p. 262).  

---
The Daoists say, “Look to what is primary, not to what is secondary or tertiary.” Ideally, Daoist sages should not deliberately try to impress people. If anything, they should deliberately try to avoid directly influencing people unless asked. To have an influence on someone is to take away a certain amount of their free will. This is another aspect of “Leave no footprints.” It is only through free will that you can choose to leave behind the Mind of Man and move toward the Mind of Dao. If you simply manipulate the Mind of Man, you are guaranteed to stay within the Mind of Man, and you will not be capable of arriving at the Mind of Dao.

(The Complete Daodejing Book 1) (p. 393). 

---
This fine point is also a big difference between Daoists on the one hand, and Hindus or Buddhists on the other. In Indian traditions, the guru is the human being who can lead you into the light. While it is also true that a genuine Daoist immortal or master can also lead you into the light, in Daoism the emphasis is more on the student choosing to follow the path, rather than relying on the master leading the student by the hand. Daoists say the master can take you to the gate (transmit all necessary instructions),but your success is determined by your own effort and diligence. However, for each authentic master that can do this, there are many who cannot, and who will instead lead you down blind alleys or “side gates,” as the Chinese call them. These are side paths that take you everywhere, but to awakening. Maybe they can take you to some nice places, which you may like or hate, but not to the Mind of Dao. Many things can impress. Special powers can. In the ancient Indian texts, some spiritual practitioners were said to have what are called siddhi or paranormal powers. For example, they were supposed to be able to walk through walls, read people’s minds, have people rise from the dead, and so on.

(The Complete Daodejing Book 1) (pp. 393-394).  

---
Daoists say you should not be too enamored by internal or external images in your mind. It is better to look at what is hidden twenty levels below the initial image. Ask yourself what any internal image actually is, where it leads you initially, and in which ways and how it influences you. Focus on where it is likely to take you at the end of the day. Are your internal images moving toward the endless circles of the Mind of Man? Or can they take you toward Emptiness and the Mind of Dao?

(p. 395).

Chapter 20 

Abandon learnedness, discard rituals, and the people will lose anxiety.
Between yes and no, how much difference is there?
Between good and evil, how much difference is there?
What other people fear, one cannot fail to fear.
Alas! A desolation without end!
People are joyous and merry,
As if enjoying a great feast,
As if climbing the terraces in spring.
I alone am still! As one not yet revealing any signs,
Like a baby who has not yet smiled.
Weary and tired! As though without a home to return to,
Most people have plenty, but I alone seem lacking.
I am a man with the heart of a fool, ignorant! Blank!
Common people are bright and intelligent,
I alone am dim and dull.
Common people are
smart and discerning,
I alone am withdrawn and unobtrusive.
Placid! Like the sea,
Blowing about! As though without anchor.
Most people have purpose,
Yet I alone am awkward, seemingly unrefined.
I am only different from others,
Because I cherish nourishment from the Mother.

(p. 407).

Find compassion and Emptiness within yourself. The idea of compassion is expressed by the most repeated phrase in the Yijing, “There is nothing that does not further.” This allows you to take the usual self-centered way the Mind of Man functions and refocuses it toward helping others. This is done not just for the good of individuals that you know, but for the larger good that may come out of it whether or not you share in it. This said, compassion has a flip side, a problem called “intelligence.” This is because compassion can be either intelligent or stupid. Intelligent compassion, besides having the genuine intent to help, also considers the consequences downstream of the compassionate intervention. Stupid compassion, influenced or reinforced by an individual’s neurosis, does not share this quality. The compassionate cure can become worse than the original problem or behavior, regardless whether the situation is physical, emotional, or mental. Giving a child a loaded gun, so they can defend themselves against whoever, can result in the child shooting themselves or an innocent bystander. 

---
Human intelligence is what creates all the “shoulds,” “woulds,” “musts,” and “oughts” in the first place, and these can go to war with each other. When compassion becomes stupid, although you may have some well-meaning, grand idea of doing something good, the poor use of intelligence in implementing the compassion can cause the actual outcome to be a total mess. Good intentions get side-tracked and the results are not good. As in the phrase, “The disease was cured, but the patient died.”

(p. 423).  

---
A mind that is capable of being dim, dull, withdrawn, unobtrusive may also be one filled with stillness and Emptiness, and the usefulness of this has been repeated many times in this text. Again, we have returned to the “heart of a fool.” What Laozi is saying here is, “Maybe you went to an Ivy League school or some equivalent, are bright and intelligent, and possibly even perceived by others as being quite something. For me, it is the values of the Mind of Dao that dominate me, rather than the values of the Mind of Man. I alone am dim and dull, I am not a big deal, I am not smart, in fact I am not much of anything. I can just perceive reality as it is! While smarter people are discerning in the ways of yin and yang, I am withdrawn. Although conventionally intelligent, I am no longer dominated by conventional yin and yang, and instead I am focusing on the world of Taiji, of Wuji. I am unobtrusive. I am engaged in the Dao’s larger reality, but not so much in the worldly reality dominated by implementing the ways of yin and yang.” He is pointing to the fact that the Mind of Dao can not only bring forth everything that occurs in the Mind of Man, but also much more than that.

What is referred to as “simple” is the ability to see and do what you do from a continuous, unbroken awareness of the Dao. Being in a state of spiritual simplicity requires nothing be added to it. If something is what it is, then elaborations, additions, and definitions are not required. You simply see and experience what is. You can proceed in a simple, natural way without needing to be clever or act dumb. This is the uncarved block that has not been manipulated. It has not had all sorts of extraneous material that creates the ego and separation between people’s input into it. This, again, is the method of wang wo or “forget ‘I.’”

(p. 668).

Chapter 32
 Dao constant, nameless.
Although simple and small, no one under Heaven can master it!
If dukes and kings could maintain it, the ten thousand things would naturally pay honor,
Heaven and Earth would unite together.
Thus, sweet dew would descend and all people, without commands, would naturally be in harmony.
Begin to make rules and names exist,
Names also exhaust existence.
Truly action is also aware of stopping,
Be aware of the place to stop, so there is no danger.
Thus, Dao’s presence under Heaven is like springs and streams flowing into rivers and seas.

(p. 666).  

---
...Daoists have practices in which they deliberately use death for personal cultivation. The participants in these practices co-mingle their energy with the energy of the dead to transform the living and help in the dead person's reincarnation process. Rather than fearing that everybody must die sooner or later, Daoists embrace death. These transformative practices are a part of the Daoist oral tradition of death and dying practices. These practices have yet to be transferred to the West. If they were transferred and their principles became widely known, it might be quite helpful in diminishing the craving for useless deaths and the tendency to be proud of them. It might help prevent people from being manipulated by others who wish to activate that craving through empty flag-waving.

(p. 665).  

---
The Daoist sense of responsibility says you need to be intelligent about exercising compassion. As a Tibetan Lama echoing Daoist sentiments once said, “No, stupid, compassion is really not a good idea. It can cause more problems than it can solve.” Daoists do have a sense of responsibility for the world. They also most definitely do recognize that for most people going from being stupid and ignorant to being wise is not easy. Not so many people try, much less act on it and succeed. That said, it is a necessity for those who wish to discover the Mind of Dao.

Chapter 27 Good travelers leave no tracks or footprints,
Good words leave no flaws or errors,
Good calculations do not use counters or markers,
Good closing has no bolts or latches, yet cannot be opened,
Good binding has no rope or string, yet cannot be loosened.
Therefore, the sage is always good in helping people,
Hence no person is abandoned,
Is always good in helping things.
Hence no thing is abandoned,
This is called practicing brightness.
Therefore, the golod person is the teacher of the person who is not good,
The person who is not good is the good person’s source of lessons.
In not honoring the teacher, in not loving the lesson, even though intelligent, you will become lost,
This is a crucial secret.

(p. 547).

Interfering with the smooth flow of the continuum leaves footprints, just as walking in the snow does. Although it is difficult to go through life without interfering and messing with the free will of others – or with the flow of the universe as it moves through situations – this is the path to leaving no footprints.

(p. 549).  

---
Everything in Daoism is about finding the natural way, from the simplest actions in daily life, to the larger questions of becoming naturally coordinated, and flowing with universe’s Great Natural in all times, places, and dimensions.

(p. 563).  

---
From the faith position, both the Daoists and the Buddhists agree on this point: the sun shines equally on all beneath it, without leaving or abandoning anything due to some judgmental values. The sun does not say, “I like you, so I shine on you,” or “I dislike you and I will not shine on you.” The sun shines on all equally. The rain coming down from the sky does not say, “I will drop on this field, but not drop on the next one.” Necessary for life, the sun and the rain accept all and abandon nothing. Likewise, Daoists often say everyone walks the path of the Dao, regardless of whether they realize it or not. Everyone is part of the continuum, whether they recognize it or not. 

(p. 567).  

---

the meaning of “the teacher of the person who is not good” is that the teacher may or may not want to interfere with the person who is not good. Sometimes the only road to reform for that person is to go through the badness in order to realize the situation from their own perspective and experience. Thus, the most the “good person” might do on the surface makes no sense whatsoever.

(p. 570).  Chapter 28

Be aware of one’s masculine, maintain one’s feminine,
Become the stream for all under Heaven.
Become the stream for all under Heaven,
Constant De will not leave, returning again to infancy.
Be aware of one’s white, maintain one’s black,
Become the pattern for all under Heaven.
Become the pattern for all under Heaven,
Constant De will not fail, returning again to Wuji.
Be aware of one’s glory, maintain one’s humility,
Become the valley of all under Heaven.
Become the valley for all under Heaven,
Constant De will be sufficient, returning again to simplicity.
Simplicity dispersed becomes utensils,
The sage uses them to become enduring officials.
Great governing does not divide

(p. 578).  

---
Being controlled by yin-yang dualism is the trap that keeps everybody sucked into the addictive habit of being attached to manifestation. This is the trap of samsara that Buddhists talk about, while nirvana is the opposite state of peace, happiness, and wonderfulness. In the end, you have to go beyond both in order to actually realize Wuji, as Wuji includes all possibilities simultaneously, from the horrible to the wonderful.

(p. 584).  Chapter 29 

---
Trying to grasp all under Heaven and force [wei] it?
I recognize that goal cannot be achieved,
All under Heaven is a spiritual vessel and cannot be forced [wei]!
Forcing [wei] it, ruins it,
Grasping it, loses it.
Thus some things lead, some follow,
Some exhale [breathe gently], some inhale [breathe hard],
Some are strong, some are weak,
Some destroy, some are destroyed.
Therefore, the sage rejects extremes, rejects excess, rejects extravagance.

(p. 604).  

---
The Water tradition teaches how to encourage something to happen without exerting any kind of force. Fire approaches often advocate for trying to make things happen. With Laozi’s Water tradition, you exert your effort into something, so that it makes some kind of sense to you. Then you back off when the strain of it starts to become very strong. After keeping your effort from going over the top, you let what has happened integrate inside you. Once it has integrated, you again put forth your full 70-percent effort to progress more and go a little bit further downstream. As often as needed, you repeat, stop, integrate, and continue until the desired result happens.
This “allowing” method will be less likely to create backlash.when force is applied in any mental or physical realm, you can be virtually guaranteed that your ego is going to rise and expand. On a psychic level, whenever force is applied, it will cause the onset of deep non-specific tiredness and imputing karma into your system. Be aware of and do your best not to engage force in your life.

(p. 609).  

---
Desire for anything that gives birth to attachment, which in turn breeds imbalance and disconnection from the Dao. Living by the following three Daoist ideas will take you a long way to arriving at the meaning of this line: (1) Needs and wants  you will not use. (3) It is okay to prefer having something as long as you do not have an internal demand to get it. It is the demand that drives people off into bad areas of attachment, not the desire itself. The desire itself is actually neutral.

(p. 709).  

---
The Dao can be understood equally through action, non-action, and direct perception.

(p. 705).  

---
A fundamental Daoist idea is that you do not want to feel as if you own anybody, especially if you wish to follow the rules of karma. There is another phrase that the Daoists use: “If you do not want to be somebody’s slave, do not become their master.” This sentiment also has resonances in Gnosticism. In thinking you own someone, you are now obligated to them. You now bind yourself in a yin-yang relationship, where you are as much their slave as they might be yours. Something else implied in this is that you can be a slave to thoughts, ideas, or beliefs. Do you own them, or do they own you, and thereby trap you in the world of Red Dust? This is to have yin and yang strangle you, rather than act as your tools.

(p. 706).

Chapter 41

 The superior scholar hears the Dao and practices it diligently,
The middling scholar, hearing the Dao, sometimes keeps to it, sometimes loses it,
The inferior scholar, hearing the Dao, heartily laughs at it,
Without that laughter it would not be the Dao.
Therefore, the following sayings are established:
The bright Dao seems dark,
Advancing on the Dao seems like retreating,
The level Dao seems uneven,
Superior De seems like a valley [hollow],
Great whiteness seems soiled,
Abundant De seems inadequate,
Established De seems unsteady,
Solid truth seems uncertain.
The great square has no corners,
The great vessel is slow to completion,
The great music is without sound,
The great image has no
shape.
The Dao is hidden, nameless, yet the Dao alone is good at nourishing and fulfilling.


BACKGROUND (Bruce): Everything that we know in this world can potentially be done with excellence, with mediocrity, or poorly. This is often expressed in Asia as “high, middle, and low.” The next few lines are referring to this phenomenon, as it applies to the potential of a human being’s ability to comprehend what is put in front of them, in terms of their involvement with engaging the Dao in a high, middle or low manner, as well as what is beyond all three.

(p. 374).  

---
Paradox is used to provoke seeing the obvious, which is hidden and the basis of many of Zen koans. Zen was a product of the mixing of Buddhism and Zhuangzi’s style of Daoism.

(p. 377).  

---
The goal of the paradoxes is to provoke the reader to see below the surface of life. Paradox enables someone to find the Taiji between a seemingly disjointed set of yin and yang. Returning to laughter, laughter has the ability to bring about joy. Enough joy also creates the ability to find a way out of the many dead-end boxes of life. It can release the contracted state which prevents the capacity to resolve many seemingly insoluble problems, and bring about extreme spiritual awareness and breakthroughs that can penetrate below the surface of life.

(pp. 376-377).

Chapter 42 
Dao gives life to one,
One gives life to two,
Two gives life to three,
Three gives life to the ten thousand things,
The ten thousand things carry yin and embrace yang,
Breath blends, thus attaining harmony.
People hate to be orphans, widowers, unworthy, yet kings and princes use these as titles.
Therefore, sometimes things lose, but gain,
Sometimes gain, but lose.
What other people teach, I also teach,
Those who are violent and aggressive do not die a natural death.
I make this the foundation of my teaching.

(p. 386).  

---
What appears obvious may in fact not be so. “Seeming uneven” can be paraphrased as: “Oh this is what it is. Now I understand what it is.” However, in terms of the Dao, this is not what it is. That is why the first chapter starts with (to paraphrase): The Dao that can be said – the Dao that can be seen – is not the true Dao. It is beyond any yin-yang dichotomy that enables anyone to ever think, “I got it,” until they realize the Eighth Energy Body, that is the Dao.
(p. 378).

A teaching Daoist might not bring up something in the beginning, but instead simply wait until a student’s ability to comprehend the point has grown. When Laozi says, “One gives life to two,” what seems like a different subject is simply an extension of the original teaching about primordial yin and yang, which may remain hidden until the perceptual capacity of the individual is up to it; that is, until various internal factors within them grow and gel. As a student of the Dao integrates and embodies more knowledge, the same principles are presented from a higher, more complete point of view.

(p. 387).  

---
In many external circumstances, yin and yang can be very useful, e.g. to build a rocket ship or write computer code. The invisible internal qualities, of which only someone with awake internal senses can be aware, are also useful in the external world. While there is ordinary yin and yang knowledge, there is the different wisdom source of Taiji, which allows human beings to be completely at peace with living with the external realities in this or any other world. These are positive ways of proactively incorporating wisdom into your life.

(p. 388).  

---
again there is a parallel to Tibet’s Dzogchen tradition, whose name means the “Great Perfection,” and which puts a great emphasis on spontaneous presence or Spontaneously Arising Perfection. From a spiritual position, if one is in wuwei, one is also in the state of the Great Image and together with the Dao. Non-action can spontaneously produce action by entering into the Dao and allowing its response to occur.

(pp. 395-396).  

---
before you speak or act, go deep inside yourself and relax. If you feel stuck, dissolve what you can. Then forget and drop any tendency to focus primarily on fulfilling your self-interest, that is on getting what you want. Wait until something wells up from deep inside that tells you what is the right thing to do or say. It will affect the ripples that emanate from you, that touch and affect yourself and others. It is not enough for what you say or do to be a purely biological, gut reaction. It has to come from a pure intuitive sense. You must follow your inner voice, even if you only know a part of what will happen as the wave ripples out.

(pp. 396-397).
