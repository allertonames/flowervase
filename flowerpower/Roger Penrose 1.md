Short Summary for https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itLIM38k2r0 by [Merlin] (https://bcin.short.gy/merlin-android)

*Roger Penrose's Orco theory links Consciousness and quantum mechanics.*
- The theory suggests that our conscious experiences and decisions are made possible through backward time jumping.
- Our brains might be registering these time jumps.

*Quantum mechanics describes the behavior of small objects in superpositions.*
- Classical mechanics fails to explain the peculiar behavior of particles at the atomic level.
- Macroscopic objects do not exhibit superposition and undergo collapse of the wave function.

*Collapsing the wave function is the measurement problem in quantum mechanics.*
- Measurement collapses the wave function
- The wave function is a mathematical expression, not a wave and particle.

*The measurement problem in quantum mechanics points out the self-inconsistency of the theory.*
- Measurement conveys the implication that there's somebody doing a measurement, but any measuring device is put outside the quantum story.
- Many views of quantum mechanics suggest that all the alternatives coexist in the universe and a conscious being is needed to navigate through them.

*The principle of equivalence states that gravity and acceleration are equivalent.*
- Time runs slower in a gravitational field.
- The principle of equivalence was a driving force behind Einstein's general theory of relativity.

*Collapse of the wave function can only be consistent with both quantum mechanics and special relativity if it is retroactive*
- The collapse of the wave function means that one state becomes the whole state while the other state does not exist
- Quantum entanglement allows for measurements in one location to instantly affect measurements in another location

*Quantum reality and gravity clash due to the superposition of quantum particles.*
- The collapse of the wave function implies jumping back in time in classical reality.
- The collapse of the wave function is likely a gravitational effect and must be consistent with both special and general relativity.

*Reality collapses into one of two choices based on gravitational field*
- Superposition allows for multiple choices, but eventually collapses into one
- Classical reality removes the collapsed choice, leaving only the other part

*Objective gravity induced wave function collapse is the genesis of consciousness.*
- The true nature of quantum randomness is still debated.
- Quantum reality only becomes retroactive in the classical world through wave function collapse.

*Quantum mechanics and general relativity are not compatible.*
- General relativity is precise and comparable to quantum mechanics.
- Quantum mechanics is inconsistent with itself and needs to be confirmed through experiments.

*Testing for the wobbliness of the state even if it doesn't collapse.*
- An experiment involving the lar satellite and mirrors could be used to test for wave function collapse.
- Timing the collapse and retroactivity of the state can provide insights.

*Memory may be stored in nuclear spins, allowing us to retrieve past information and change future outcomes.*
- The retroactive aspect of memory retrieval may be due to the unique feature of nature that allows cognitive jumps into the past.
- If memory retrieval was based solely on normal chemical processes, it would be quickly wiped out.

*The Hemingway Paradox questions whether conscious decisions can be made quickly.*
- Hemingway's suicide by shotgun raises questions about the speed of conscious decisions.
- In neurophysiology, it is believed that decisions made in games like pingpong are actually unconscious and done unconsciously.

*Our decisions are referred backwards in time by milliseconds according to Roger Penrose's theory.*
- Roger Penrose's theory suggests that our decisions can be influenced by events that occur later in time.
- This theory could explain the reaction time observed in athletes, which seems faster than conscious choice.

*Paramal cells in the cerebrum play a role in conscious control of rapid motions*
- These cells are not found in the cerebellum which is not conscious
- The retroactive scheme is consistent with the libbit experiment which suggests that Free Will is an illusion

*Roger Penrose's 1979 study showed evidence of subjects registering retroactivity.*
- He contacted Dennis Pearl, the statistician from the study, who confirmed the initial interpretation but couldn't remember details due to the lack of raw data.
- Adjacent researchers in Psychology also study temporal processing deficits and causal order perception, which assumes time moves in One Direction.

*Physics experiments that challenge mainstream views are difficult to perform and often ignored.*
- It is challenging to test new ideas in physics through experiments due to a bias towards mainstream views.
- There are instances where evidence of events before the Big Bang is being ignored by the scientific community.

*Computational devices like today's AI can never be conscious or intelligent.*
- People often ignore obvious signals and phenomena because they don't align with their preconceived notions.
- Machine consciousness requires true understanding and comprehension, which current AI lacks.

*Understanding transcends computational rules and consciousness cannot be explained solely through computational systems.*
- The belief that rules only give truths transcends their actual use.
- The collapse of the wave function and protoconsciousness are non-computational processes.

*Believing in mathematical rules is different from religious belief.*
- Mathematical rules can be proven and understood through evidence and clear logic.
- Belief in mathematical rules does not require consciousness or awareness.

*Mathematics is like archaeology, exploring a real Platonic world with its own reality.*
- Mathematics has a reality separate from any practical applications.
- GÃ¶del's Incompleteness Theorem shows that certain mathematical truths cannot be proven.

*Consciousness is not computation and computers lack consciousness because they don't understand*
- There is an algorithm in our heads that we don't know, which gives us the right answer
- The Goodstein theorem, proved by Harrison and Koby, cannot be proven using ordinary mathematical induction

*Understanding is a selective advantage that has led to the development of civilizations.*
- An ability to do pure mathematics is not a selective advantage, but understanding is.
- Animals also exhibit understanding, such as elephants retaining memories of their deceased.

*Consciousness is not a computation.*
- Consciousness cannot be understood in terms of computation.
- The speaker focuses on a specific aspect of consciousness and does not comment on other qualities.

*The collapse of the wave function in quantum mechanics can potentially lead to a non-computable device.*
- The notion of computation is specific and there are non-computable things in classical mechanics.
- A collapsing quantum computer is a misnomer as it is no longer a computational device.

*The quantum reality is retroactively determined through the superposition of alternatives.*
- The quantum reality exists alongside the classical reality.
- The reduction of the quantum state determines which branch of reality becomes the classical reality.

*Conservation of quantum information after annihilation*
- Is there a preservation of information after it annihilates an alternative path?
- This question will be addressed in the follow-up video.
