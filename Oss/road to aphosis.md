My hero’s journey is still sticking to the script albeit loosely and dependent on perspective. Perhaps I’m riding a pendulum swinging from the road of trails to apotheosis.

￼

The titles are a little ambiguous and they’re not to be taken literally, firstly to recap recent events.
Meeting with the Goddess –Can also represent the female side of the hero (his anima or ‘soul’) which, if he can join, will make him whole. The Goddess can be good and evil often in the same package, in a sense all women represent the Goddess.

I’ve met with a number of Goddess/Woman as the Temptress they’re usually good at first then turn ‘bad’, controlling or for a more woo-woo explanation, unwillingly channel the invisible adversarial spirit that will try to halt my progress to Apotheosis.
Temptation/Temptress – Is to test (and hence demonstrate) the integrity of the hero by placing easy gratification or other gain in their path. By refusing this, the hero demonstrates himself to be true to heroic values and dedicated above all else to achievement of the primary goal.

Since overcoming forms of temptation in Cambodia, I’ve had comparatively minor examples of temptations recently, but I feel like I could be swishing around in this whales belly until I fully expunge all my temptations.
Atonement with the Father – The father represents power, and particularly what ever power is ultimately over the hero. If this power can be taken, removed or incorporated, the hero is permitted to a higher plane. Similar to the Goddess the father figure may be benevolent or “monstrous” and are often both in the same package reflecting what the hero needs at that point in the journey.

Recognizing, challenging and removing this ultimate power has seemingly been the main feature over the past few months.

I’ve experienced far too many anomalous, weird, bizarro events over the years and right from the start finding context, answers and solace for the strange high weirdness has always been there. Years of peeking behind the veil of normality hasn’t satisfied me or given peace of mind that I’ve slayed that monstrous dragon.

Maybe now that I have conquered temptation I’m allowed further down the rabbit hole as the Zen proverb says- “When the student is ready, the teacher appears”

In the past few months, coincidentally (if you believe in that sort of thing) events, people, personalities and behaviors that I’ve encountered reflected precisely what I was discovering and learning from new sources of research and peoples testimonies of similar experiences. It was like a practical lesson along with academic context with reasons and answers. My previous inclinations of what on earth was happening to me were being confirmed, experiences I had that previous friends/’handlers’ were quick to ignore and dismiss, were exactly described by other experiencers, the type of events, reactions, feelings, thoughts and so on were startlingly the same. I could now attach a label to them, and a bit like Rumpelstiltskin where naming the demon takes it’s power away (also how Magicians conjure and bind incorporeal spirits) I take back control –  Ignorance is a slave, knowledge is freedom. – Gospel of Phillip

I still have plenty to learn but I know better now what I’m looking at, identifying and removing the adversarial invisible power that wields it’s influence in this world that wants you to live in ignorance of it, gives me the clearance to a higher plane and in some sense onto Apotheosis.
Apotheosis – After trials such as resisting Woman as Temptress and the reconciliation of Atonement with the Father, the hero transcends, achieving a higher place. This is a point of realization in which a greater understanding is achieved. Armed with this new knowledge and perception, the hero is resolved and ready for the more difficult part of the adventure.

The dictionary describes ‘apotheosis’ as ‘The elevation of a person to the status of a god’ a better interpretation i would posit is the realization of the divine spirit that lies within.

If you bring forth what is within you, what you bring forth will save you. If you do not bring forth what is within you, what you do not bring forth will destroy you. – Gospel of Thomas

Ignorance is a slave, knowledge is freedom. If we know the truth we shall find the fruits of the truth in us. If we join it, it will fulfill us. – Gospel of Phillip

An un-examined life is not worth living – Socrates

The un-lived life is not worth examining. – Alphonso Lingis added.

Shadow work itself has turned out to be spiritual work of the highest depth and quality and is indeed a Hero’s Journey and a Great Work. – Jung

By actually doing the esoteric inner works one gains salvation – Boris Mouravieff

One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious – Jung

Before I was enlightened, I chopped wood and carried water, after I was enlightened I chopped wood and carried water.  -Zen proverb



That force that is wielded in the world cannot touch one who is not identified with it.



I found the above quotes a bit more meaningful recently. I take from them that we don’t have to grow a mature mighty oak before gaining salvation and enlightenment, but to  germinate that divine seed within, nurture it, and not letting it wither is the key to letting the universe ‘see’ you and unfold the archetype path that lays in front of you.

What lies ahead? is still a mystery but I think the pendulum will continue to swing possibly repeating and allowing the lessons to sink in deeper before the Ultimate Boon is revealed.
