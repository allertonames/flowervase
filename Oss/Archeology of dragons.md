all right so in archeology of dragons I guess we should probably start with why we would we use those words archeology is is a story of layers basically it's not an x marks the spot journey and each layer will tell you something different so it's not really about finding the first instance of something it's about finding how something begins and how it changes through time so in the case of the Dragon which by the way next time we need to get to why I didn't use this one every time in the last say four months where they've been putting this together or working on the research people have like so you mean dragons like a metaphor right and I'm like well I do because when you talk about dragons you're always talking about a metaphor but we use the ocean as a metaphor and I'm pretty sure it's still there so the idea of something being metaphorical is something being non-existent is is very limited so the idea so we're going to go through the layers pretty much from from now from modern day to where I think we can find potentially the beginning of the dragons story so that means we need to talk about the mythology of mythology this is the what you tend to hear and it's sort of fairly unthinking is that Dragons might be part of the human brain there's some sort of universal mythology but the reality is there are very few Universal beliefs not even Sun worship is universal so whilst something is found all over the world that doesn't make it Universal a part of the human brain because you'll find that there non randomly distributed and if something's non randomly distributed another factor is involved in how it moves if dragons were part of our brain then it would be as randomly just distributed as eyesight but it's not there's there's it is a story or a myth theme that has been moved around through time as I said the globally popular and non randomly distributed as for why probably not this but we will here's an example of what I mean by non randomly distributed myths this is and it sort of came up yesterday the separation of heaven and earth myth which you obviously find in Egypt you kind of see from I'm gonna try and do it for you guys so you kind of see a Southeast to Northwest arc and the darker areas for those at the back to can't see is depth of motif so there's about between nine and ten in the areas that are dark moving up to lighter where you get less than three motifs per myth so you can do this with stories and start to see the shape of them and that pretty much points you in a very good direction for where you need to go next in in looking for myths so that's what we're gonna do it's how we're going to calibrate the dragon what you can once you've found an overlay of the myths you need to look for genetics and archaeological evidence and where all these three things overlap you can start to think or paint a picture about what's going to happen so in the case of dragons when they overlap with elite or royal associations and crucially the beginning and ending of a world and whether or not they're good or bad allows you to kind of calibrate a sequence of dragons and I do mean dragon this is important because obviously it's a very old myth and it's it's found everywhere it kind of touches on the idea of snakes in the ocean and other monsters and the Stars and Kings and what-have-you but we're going to stick as close as possible to dragons we do touch into these things because otherwise you lose too much of the signal and you end up telling a history of the world rather than an archaeology of dragons the word itself pointers in the right direction it's Greek for basically giant water serpent and the original word probably comes from the verb to see clearly it's either that or like a glittering to see clearly is glittering and that could be like scales or something underwater but that's where the arm the word comes from so we're going to begin talking about I guess how history works so we have you recognize mr. Carter on the back on that side meanwhile this guy's terrifying I if you told me if you told me he's still alive and maybe even in this room I would I would believe it they say yeah but we get we get the kind of ghosts of our macro stories from exercises like this because the past or the story of the past changes with every present so if you think for instance during the Renaissance even though they couldn't read hieroglyphs everything came from Greece in Egypt and then we have in high Victorian times it came from Mesopotamia and also sort of what of what was described this to me was sort of like pre Hindu India there the Hindus were morally corrupt but a lot of stuff came from India and they got it wrong and they needed fine upstanding British soldiers to to fix it during the accordian age where you start to see the likes of V Gordon child arbitrarily picking a time and a place that he liked in the world and saying that's when civilization began and everything before it is barbarism and everything afterwards his civilization because it looks more like London we kind of need to get past this we sort of need to realise that the past is political and it's sort of our story or our job especially as magicians to to earn that story that's a shamanic tribal roll to a to own the story of our bloodlines and our gods and at the moment too much of it has been given over to people who have had agendas they don't work with us yes so that's an oversimplification but what sort of happened with the diffusion which is the term where okay so an idea started somewhere in a part of the world you like where there were white people maybe and then moved into parts of the world that you didn't like quite so much around the 80s and 90s with the rise of things like post-modernism it became clear that this sort of idea is kind of racist and so the lazy solve and it was pretty much a band-aid the post-structuralist band-aid was all right it everyone independently invented everything no further questions and that's the trouble so we've gone we've gone from this is unhelpful to this is unhelpful and we need to find a pendulum swing swing somewhere in the middle and I think the dragon is one of the best guides to doing this because if you shine some light on the Dragons story large chunks of the history of Western esotericism sort of fall back into place or at least recontextualize so we're going to start going layer by layer from the modern day and by the modern day I mean Wales in 1959 so we're gonna start there and I mean that if we've had the dragon for 1400 years and it's still political under pressure the Queen had to and by the way it is the best flag in the world but the Queen had to go yeah only the red dragon and the green and white flag should be flown above government buildings in Wales so that association of power and and right to rule is still associated with the dragon here of course is where it lives D December's my Welsh is terrible and the story of Oregon's Tower is very obviously Astro theological there are the red and the white dragons fighting every evening but the first evidence of dragons appear with the Germanic invaders into Britain and they're always associated just like Grendel with the right to rule one way or the other and the dragon is either a sign you are either in control of the dragon or descended from it and Dragons stories are about right to rule and that is particularly the case in instances of invasions because that's when the right to rule is up for grabs this one this is a lovely story but it's also kind of sad I found it in an old Edwardian and folk tale book but basically calmer than share 1763 a dragon lands on the ruins of an old Norman keep and a local boy returned from wars in France he wasn't just on holiday snuck up the river because it was sort of breathing fire and scaring people and shot it and it fell into the river and sputtered and died in front of everyone and it's a slowly decayed in the corpse washed out to sea I think that's really sad but it's fascinating I think because if we knew that local boy's name I bet you he was from a prominent family in the town because whilst we associate dragons with Alexis and George and religion in the UK in particular the vast majority of British dragon stories aren't religious they have to do with local prominent personalities so again it comes down to that and local right to rule this in George himself only got his dragon in the thirteenth century and I've written about this on the blog but I think the Normans chose him as a saint because at the time they were still having many problems with Wales and so he was this foreign warrior saint who kills a dragon and there are those damn Welsh I think that may actually feed into it it also ties into the sense of legitimacy that you get through some Patrick or anyone else this idea of removing snakes or having a power over the dragon is again associated with some sort of royal legitimacy so that's sort of moving us as we go backwards in time from 1959 through 1700 we're going to run through the dark ages I think we need to look again at the golden legend I don't have my New York Times for the 13th century but I'm pretty sure it was the most popular book in Europe whilst after Gutenberg you did have local language Bibles there at the realities they weren't that many of them this was local language everyone read this and it is basically a Dark Age Project Blue Book so all the weird UFO stuff the japonais talks about is in here all the crazy stories of saints and ghosts and the Grateful Dead of bar all this stuff is in the Golden Legend and that's where George gets his dragon and also saint sylvester the dragon of Rome you can't really see that but that's what he's doing there it's a giant stinky dragon underneath Rome then his Christianity got rid of it Margaret of Antioch I like this one she was eaten by
 the devil when she was in prison the devil appeared to as a form of a dragon but it couldn't digest crucifix so it vomited her back up or in some versions exploded now that's a very obvious Jonah analog which is important because if you look at Hebrew and Mesopotamian dragons there is constant blurring between whale and dragon and sea monster because of course if it's the Bronze Age and you're out on a boat and you see a whale yeah it's it's scary is a dragon anyway but that's quite important because we're going to see that typology of story shapes moving backwards in time he's a hoard more beasties working backwards from the 12th century Catalan dragon Drake two legs sometimes of cow and lion heads poison and Bert poisonous breath school Tony Saturnian dragon kills with its gaze and is immortal I can't do that one in Hungarian but it's a giant dragon in human form with multiple heads it gets weaker as each head is removed and then a smoke which is a fire-breathing multi-headed Slavic dragon now if you know your grimoire or if you know your Stratton Kent all classics these things should be or these traits should be very familiar to you and it's in kind of draconian mythology that you see some of the strongest threads of the survivals of monsters and spirits that also show up in grimoires through the classical world like early Dark Age and in and perhaps more importantly I think we get additional association with treasure and grimoire spirits here because not only is the dragon associated with right to rule it's also associated with as a result bloodlines and dead Kings and people who've come from before and they tend to be the ones buried with all their loot this is the Grecian pivot so now we're in ancient Greece Oh actually we're mostly going to skip it and go to archaic Greece instead it's dragons all the way down and this is Hesiod so dragons kind of dragons kind of dragons dragon some dragons Hydra this is quite interesting because we have the most complete at the very beginning of Greece layering of generations and Dragons and if something shows up at the fully forms at the beginning of a culture it's a foreign import which we'll look at in a sec I love this it's something actually touched on briefly yesterday morning composite images appear in archaic Greek art around the time of city formation you can actually associate the rise of organization with an increase in the production of monstrous images or composites as fancy people call them in the 8th century BC art you'll see in Greece it's primarily domestic less than a hundred years later it's fantastic it snakes its Griffins its dragons and the the thinking behind this dr. Wenger of you Cole they think you behind this is it was the established social order was disrupted by higher-quality foreign goods and elite membership became defined by ownership of non-greek goods and iconography just like anything else like having a having a Bugatti it's it's a status symbol because you can either have the shitty Greek made stuff or you can have these exotic things coming from the east and they become status symbols just like they do today but they're ambivalent I love this this is David when grows quote these re-enter lysing objects was sought after but there are also potentially threatening they are monsters they are foreign they are what have you I need so for instance in Attica you see attempts of attempts to incorporate monsters into the existing political order to demonstrate the political orders power over them as examples in Crete tower 8 which is a foreign monster becomes a libation carrier in Minoan palaces so this thing that was scary out there it's like having an exotic pet and in Greece you see sphinxes and Griffins arrive around this time on the mainland and they sort of housed in the newly ordered mega Ron so as the political shapes of these sort of religious political buildings reform you get foreign monsters in a position almost have not subservience but control like I have power over this thing which is where I think his reptilians genuinely come from because lizards were like the it bag so that that reptile and elite association he's correct about but it's not because the queen is a lizard it's because 3,000 years ago dragons were the thing you had this is the source of the monsters obviously we're moving into Eurasia that's this is really cool this is Siberian tattooing there's some kind of fish monster and this is awesome you also have the linguistic survey that show that we're looking in that Eurasian world's Ozzy or Aziz is the arresting word it's related to the Sanskrit word aji and apparently I got this off a legitimate website I promise and these words are distantly related to the Greek office or and the Latin angrist so we have a indo-european words so the Eurasian overlay of the serpent dragon came from this direction we could kind of imply that from the location of the monsters but this is how we move further backwards in time what stop me if you've heard this one snake Apple of immortality garden this is la Don and it's has buried A's which incidentally means originating from the evening star these are the Hesperides this is a garden it means originating from the evening star which could I think be a persistence of asteroid theology as well because of the devil's association with the morning slash evening star and Venus but that is right there in Greece as well you can see the import of these mesopotamia my dears going backwards Luton Luton in Canaanite is like la Don and it's also where we get the word Leviathan from so this is the actual devil oh and like Rahab which is Rahab is weird Leviathan presides over chaotic ocean that Yahweh pacifies when he defeated in combat we kind of skip over those descriptions well judeo-christians we'll skip over the descriptions that are quite faintly Mesopotamian Yahweh as a big God with a stick kind of thing but I love them I love these kind of echoes in Canaanite um you get lutein which is low tan or whatever is a seven-headed serpent and was defeated by bass top one so that's kind of the the Yahweh analog in that version ra's destruction of Apophis that I want to sort of touch briefly on Egypt because they had many beasties but we're kind of I'm looking for the archaeological layers of how the dragon ended up almost in the Western mystery tradition and some of that came through Egypt but we kind of have to jump around it but Roz destruction of Apophis is a similar version to this kind of destroying of the snake type and interestingly to this is how we can kind of point it back into the Near East after killing Lewton down south one moves into a very las vegas palace of gold and lapis lazuli there's a 2000 BC Egyptian story called tale of the shipwreck and a lone survivor washes up on this island that has a palace of gold and lapis lazuli and it's ruled by this giant human headed snake so you can kind of see the echoes especially when you're talking about naval trade you can see the echoes of these stories bouncing around in the Near East a Giants guarding the cedar forest where the gods dwell head of a lion tail and penis of a snake he's decapitated by Gilgamesh and Gugu mesh uses his head for a pot repair to to ward off by the demon so he predates the Gorgon by a thousand years so we start to see these months two snake things we start to it becomes clear where a lot of the monsters and beasties that we're talking about come from and this is why I mean when when you do history or classics it's almost like you want to swipe the google map just a bit off the Mediterranean so that you can get this because on this side you have her upper so from 2500 BC these trade routes go through all the good places up the Indus Mohenjo daro harappa Iranian Plateau or the Arabian Peninsula which actually had a lot less water in it at the beginning of that byblos Greece Egypt we like the history of monsters is a history of Commerce and this is kind of where you start to get the most recognizable this is like the origin of the Dragons as we Egypt's protodynastic period much like Greece's begins with this flowering of near-eastern monstrous imports you see that on particular palettes it's maybe difficult to make out there but the monsters they get are all Griffin's and and and basically Near Eastern rather than Egyptian demons but you expect that because urbanization is always preceded by the expansion of those commercial networks that's how you build cities and wealth by trading it with other cities around your network so I like elites obtained novel sources of distinction and prestige boring but essentially it's the same process you see in ancient Greece at the time but now several thousand years earlier it becomes very interesting and very exciting to have foreign monsters and you see on the Nama palette humans are last suing monsters that only appeared in Sumeria a few centuries earlier so that's quite an indication of sustained contact that wasn't this a slow gradual diffusion speaking of Sumeria we move into part four you get the same set of layers of monsters all the way down well these are gods but chaos dragon at the top Sumeria is the earliest written record of I guess what we would call a Eurasian time measurement they measure time in eons and you see that reflected in the gods and the fact that the the myth cycle is stories of a beginning and ending of the world usually with the destruction of the old one and the building of the universe out of its corpse and in the case of Sumeria that corpse was a dragon that was Tiamat and that idea persists so we can see I think Murdock slaying Tiamat in Tim had in the top left and that's kind of to make it look a bit more what it looks like I didn't draw that by the way Thank You Internet and even a few a few centuries later and a different being you get mu Shu Shu and
 it's a constellation Leo and Hydra so you not only get the persistent iconography from the beginning of Sumeria you also get a persistence of their Astro theology that the dragon represents or is from the stars in umeå leash you tear my salty waters of chaos merged with the sweet waters to create the sky in the earth so that's that you have separation of sky enough in Sumeria as well in several verses show that turns into a dragon or generates cohorts of dragons which is super awesome Marduk grasps a hub to shield himself from her poison sends an evil wind at her that she swallows distends her stomach and he shoots are open and build creation from her corpse so again we're starting to see like sin Margaret that that same typology of a dragon beast being swelled up so soon Margaret which is an analog of sin George is itself a typological version of this story so we're starting to see the shape of the stories move now into 2500 BC so where we're getting in deep we can go deeper nunu and azog no one's quite sure what azog is but it is very probably a dragon the the texturing complete it appears is the last sort of form of snake opponents for a new nutter so this is proper early sumerian stuff it was a child of heaven and earth so I think we can sort of put them maybe was AG one generation down from the separation creation story the plants this is really cool the plants had declared him their king so like there's some kind of farm occur association with plants and Dragons and and rulership going on here you see that with Marduk protecting himself from poison with some kind of mystery plant as I guess sometimes a tree but more often a serpent and then sends the sky afternoon utter in serpent form and that's obviously that could be comets that could be a specific pasture but it's definitely an Astra theological story so the Babylonians got their dragons from Samaria we need to ask where the Sumerians got their dragons from because they sit at the beginning of what V Gordon child would call civilization the tablet of destinies I don't know if anyone knows much about the tablet of destinies it's along with the Holy Grail like my favorite mythological object that's really weird and it's all about no one is quite sure what it does but it's about power and the right to rule so you see it in the enumeration and a number of stories coming up and there's at the time so the very earliest stories of Samaria there's confusion over who owns this tablet and and stories of legitimate ownership so its first bestowed by Tiamat so it's obviously something to do with that right to rule coming from the original dragon lair of creation Maddox seizes it because he needed it for some stuff or during the universe but then he gives it back to his grandfather so the tablet has power if you possess it but he might have knows that it doesn't belong to him and it belongs to his grandfather so it's this weird object that makes you control the universe and and the gods and the kings controlled the universe because it was a sort of stellar processional not processional in astrological sense but it was a stellar play out the gods fulfilled a function as did the kings in Samaria so this is like the power plug and you could right there see at the beginning of Samaria confusion over well who gets this what's going on and that I suspect is a reflection of incoming cultural impact from somewhere else basically an invasion cultural or otherwise because isolation is relative everyone will tell you but if you've read books that are older than five years ago about Sumeria it's true it's a language isolate which is fine but if you overlay the time distance or if you ever lay the beginnings of Samaria where depending on where you date that you start to see the what happens is that we're missing half of it the flannery and transgression is when the water from the arabian gulf came back in after the end of the it sort of sloshed so as much low at the end of the Ice Age went up went back came back again so the last sort of death all over the end of the Ice Age was only about 4000 5000 BC in the Arabian Gulf just where we see these things show up so we're missing half of it I don't think it's that isolated at all but the other thing is it's an isolator if you only look next door it's related to what is currently a hypothetical language that shouldn't be alarmed davidic and it has dozens of Austronesian words we're gonna head to Western Asia in a sec but technically before English it was the language that had the widest distribution on planet earth because it goes all the way from Madagascar along the south of India Southeast Asia outer than to the Pacific and to some parts of South America lands it appear mythical in Sumeria at the beginning like Dillman they show up in early stories but by the end they're showing up as trading lists they're like oh this stuff came from do more and so many ships came from Jamila because you know what the Sumerians like they wrote everything down they're very OCD so the places that they refer to that we think might be mythical can't be they were real and they're accessible they say like guys I'm gonna have to explain to you at the back this is why DNA haplotype T it's part of a theory which I quite like which is that there is a afro druidic connection the didn't Dravidian culture where it came from and where it went is still weird and we start to see genetic links between places that were quite strong in it incidentally for Egypt nerds odds-on for punt is here and the theosophist thought punt was India and they may have both been right because that I mean we haven't found punt obviously but you have a strong genetic association between India through here and the Horn of Africa so they may well have been something there that looked Indian to the Theosophists but actually matched where the Egyptian or Egyptologist think they went the linguistic relationships so Sumerian alaimo druidic drove it ik remember the separation of heaven and earth you're starting to see that same shape from the South from Southeast Asia up into Europe I just want to do one little thing about be dictating the Conte ting of it is arbitrary and it's hugely hugely political so we won't go into it everyone inside India says ten thousand years old everyone outside says the opposite that's it's caught up in Indian nationalism and what-have-you but I will say the the dating for when it was written down is is entirely arbitrary especially as the system of like memorizing it and repeating it he's very very old so that kind of swings back within Ford's it may well so technically this story may well be the oldest dragon story but it's too political to Sato it's the same kind of idea though Indra defeats Vritra first one of the Serpent's by dashing him to pieces with a thunderbolt and that releases all the world's water and that Ritter had dammed up with his body the water rose to conceal his body parts so again you see a very similar type to Tiamat and a story of Tiamat there it's about deluge it's about dragons it's about building pieces of the universe keep them in the back of your head so at 4,000 BCE give or take we're going to stop digging briefly because we kind of need to go into what it is we may have found so are we going to talk about literalism how does suddenly become a myth this is something we potentially need to get over as a cultist especially looking for one explanation for things so oh it's just that this is as close as I could get so Magana or extra dimensional phenomena into play with tribal history local landscape and skyscape which includes the stars and a political environment and you can pretty much start anywhere here and it will scoop up stuff as it goes so the dragon isn't just kingship it isn't just the constellation Draco it isn't just a way of recording elite bloodlines histories it's a mix of them so the dragon exists the way democracy exists and Buddhism exists and potentially some other things there's my lovely dr. Jacques Vallee well this is from his most recent book wonders in the sky the accounts most closely resembling UFO crashes within the scope of our chronology come from the Chinese law and described the fall of dragons for example dragons fighting in the sky in 1169 ad pearls like carriage wheels fell down on the ground where they were found by herd boys another one fourth century AD King saw a black dragon in the sky its glittering eyes illuminated the whole vicinity so that the huge monster was visible till it was enveloped by clouds which gathered from all sides that's a very youthful logical event seeing lights in the sky and then having it affect the local weather the next morning traces of its scales was seen over five miles until the rain washed them away glittering eyes illuminated the whole vicinity looks to me well in my head because my head is weird like the last 10 minutes of Close Encounters but it also looks to me kind of like we remember when we said that the origin of the word dragon to see clearly or to glitter or Sparkle I think maybe it gets its scales from phenomena like this oh and I love this one let's get a cold for a bit Athanasius Kircher got a letter from a guy in Switzerland I saw a very bright dragon about with flapping wings go from a cave in a great rock and a mountain called pilatus toward another cave known as flew on the opposite side of lake lucerne its wings were agitated with much celerity whatever that is its body was long as well as its tail and neck and what's good about this letter is he's like it's not a meteor I know what a meteor is this was a dragon I'm that's why I'm sending you this note I am NOT a crazy person but I saw a dragon that's really nice this I write you your reverence in case you should doubt the dragon's truly exist in nature I don't think he did this is a kind of stuff
 Athanasius got up to bless him dragons all this kind of weird stuff he's really cool we should he for instance thought he'd decipher hieroglyphs I got a completely wrong but he got it wrong in a predictive way so that there was I forget where it was there was a tipped-over obelisk and whilst his translation was wrong he knew what was going to be written on the other side based on his system so I have no idea that would be cool to play with Kent so let's get a bit more local 5 23 18 still up in the sky dragons lions and other furious wild beasts fighting in the air in the west of Kent it rained wheat and soon after great drops of blood upon which ensued extreme dearth you don't say but that's that same lights and things fighting in the sky and interestingly that dates to well that's loosely contemporaneous with say vortigaunts tower so it's a lot of space weather going on at the time that we call dragons we wouldn't call them that today if it happened today dragons and shamans so let's move from Magana into druggie Magana 1960s anthropologist Michael Hanna spent years living in the Amazon he was one of the sort of ayahuasca anthropologist pioneers before it became kind of dickish and obvious to do that he encountered dragons on his trips giant reptilian entities that resided in the base of the brain where the skull meant the spinal cord they showed him I love this quite cool they showed him a prehistoric planet earth and these dragons descending from space these huge black blobs with tiny wings and they said that they were fleeing an enemy from deep outer space and they had created the earth so that they had somewhere to hide and that they were the true rulers of the earth and basically one day this bad things gonna come and get us well that's yeah paging mr. Reich and so this is a weird thing to be told and so Michael well dr. Hana what have you got a bit anxious about this and he went and spoke to a local shaman who said that the dragons have told me that they run the earth and there's this they're the true Lords of the earth and the shamans like they're always saying that it's like it's like you're homophobic uncle at Christmas it's like ah they're always saying that they're just the Lords of the outer darkness and I'm a fair enough but I quite like that idea that they're they're dicking with him they're obviously dicking we like as well we get onto local girl a local girl dr. Sarina demonic phenomena dragons are associated with what John keel might call window areas offering two news one of them it is definitely quite weird there you have a whole bunch of other stuff in there in the area but that particular place is associated with ghosts and barrows and so on you have dragons appearing at Winkley castle in Devon in the 16th century and dragons appearing over barrows in the same sort of area so you still have that kind of weird elite and ghostly window area association which brings it halfway back from its that in-between dr. Jacques Vallee and the drug dragons I love this and Vikings left dragon graffiti in sight maze how they broke into it in like the eighth century maybe people know more ninth century when they were looking for treasure obviously there's no treasure it's a you know dunya lithic site but they left dragon graffiti inside which I'm pretty sure as a putt repaid because they were basically on their own kind of Hobbit journey of some description speaking of they don't tend to stay missing for long armed dragons if you think about cultural change either associated with elites or even in the 20th century how the swings happen you think of the 60s you think of Dungeons and Dragons and both of these things really spun culture off into directions that would be unimaginable if you if you thought in the 50s that the biggest movies and games of the year would be to do with dragons and all you know and the occult in magic and all this it would be a pretty tough sell everyone knows Tolkien said this I desired dragons with a profound desire of course in my timid body I did not wish to have them in the neighborhood of course not but he actually that was his most famous saying but he gets pretty close to him to basically calling out the reality of a lot of the things that he writes about not Middle Earth but the beings that he uses to create middle-earth so the dweller in the quiet and fertile plains may hear of the tormented hills and the unharvested sea and long for them in his heart for the heart is hard though the body be soft so that's quite he's basically but he went astral essentially this is he had some kind of hyper imaginative process where these things became real and this is this is what I mean like a dragon is no idle fancy whatever may be his origins in fact or invention the dragon in legend is a potent creation of man's imagination richer in significance than his barrel in his then his Baron is his gold I must have done that wrong whatever so he's basically saying don't don't dismiss this don't do the I just made this up there's something about this particular form that does things so what is a literal Dragon we're just sort of raced through weather phenomena space where the phenomena asterism so that's star stuff psychological artifacts thank you professor Tolkien the neighbors some kind of McGurn Ian UFO connection devices for conveying tribal identity and elite status symbols and the thing is because they're non randomly distributed cultures with dragons and counter dragons cultures without dragons don't encounter dragons by the way that's that's my grandfather showing a crocodile to the Duke of Edinburgh so lizard meats lizard I have a weird family this is sort of out of Africa genetic information to ignore most of it the most interesting arc is we sort of went up and out pretty quickly straight out of Africa so we're going to sort of zoom in we've gone down through here we're going to go here because actually we go up and out and then from here we go up and here and here and over so we're gonna zoom in on this bit Sunderland obviously at the time when people were first migrating into Southeast Asia there was much more land in fact twice the size of India went underwater at the end of the Ice Age we learned here I love this dr. Joanna Nichols has this really it's sound I'm gonna talk you through it but at a high level because it's it gets quite nerdy but there's a linguistic dating method based on the language structure and like yes no so does it have subject-object-verb yes no and you can actually do you can trace languages back further than you can doing traditional linguistic methods because linguistic methods rely otherwise unknown words so they have a horizon of about 5,000 BC which sounds like a lot of time until you want to start overlaying linguistics with very early population movements and one of the things you find is that linguistic complexity decreases as cultural complexity increases because that's an indication of an empire like linguistic complexity decreased around the world with Rome with the British Empire what have you because local languages were replaced by well you have less complexity because there are less languages the first rise of cultural complexity she found she started this information in the early 90s occurred in Ireland South East Asia 30,000 to 20,000 years ago so there was one linguistic event about 65 thousand years ago in Africa the next major increase in cultural complexity happened in Ireland South East Asia 30 to 20 thousand years ago this is early 90s so the art of Africa project everyone kind of assumed they were guessing at the dates but it's very very interesting that we're now starting to see alignments of genetics and linguistic and geological evidence so circum-pacific colonization happened from Sunderland up and around so from sort of like New Guinea up the coast of Asia and then down into the Americas realistically there was some which I can't I can't prove in this presentation but there was some transoceanic stuff as well but that's the the major migration wave actually came up rather than through it that also happened westward so Austronesian as I said the languages in this area stretch all the way to Madagascar words such as cinnamon and actually lemon appear at the very very beginning like this of Indesit ease those words appeared in kind of Sanskrit and there Austronesian cinnamon is a basically New Guinean Southeast Asian word and there they are at the bottom of our first cities specific genetic markers linked back to do draconian cultures we'll get onto that in a sec and if you think about the Nagas which is much much later than Harappa they are an invading reptile people coming from the east so there is some kind of east to west reptile correlation this should look familiar these are specific genetic links between the Austronesian homelands and Eurasia in the South Pacific turkey UAE India South India particularly and up through Asian of course out into the Pacific where you were literally here be dragons this I find interesting and it's just almost a little bit of an aside the end of the Ice Age coincides with what dr. Oppenheimer called the Age of crocodiles and this is the first time since we left Africa that we had no choice but to share our food supply with a super predator lions and tigers are actually very easy to avoid but if you are in the mangroves if you're fishing in this kind of grey water which all of it is we were subject to predation at higher levels and I find that quite compelling that that happened around the same time as we start to at least be able to prove depth of dragon mythology and also the spread of them up and I'll show you why this is cool Isaiah so Leviathan and he will slay the crocodile that is in the sea Psalm 74 now dudes crush the heads of the crocodiles by the waters thou didst shatter the heads of
 Leviathan so quite a few thousand years later and yes there are a few crocodiles in between New Guinea and Israel but if these stories if the story shape has tumbled down and I think it has this may well be quite interesting especially as you take it up north which were gonna do now 30 north this is from Marco Polo's diaries anyone ever read them they're amazing he has this thing about fiat currency like the Chinese were using paper money and he's like this is insane this will never catch on it's only here because if no one accepts that the king will kill them this is ridiculous we'll never do that any well sorry yeah he obviously encountered a crocodile leaving the city of yuichi here are seen huge serpents ten paces in length and ten spans in a goat of the body potentially exaggerating but then we have the jaws are wide enough to swallow a man the teeth are large and sharp the whole appearance is so formidable that neither man nor any kind of animal can approach them without terror others are met with a smaller size being eight or six or five paces long so he's obviously he saw a dead mangled large crocodile in marketplace somewhere and had this thing explained to him in the daytime he's got that wrong by reasons of the great heat they lurk in cabins went at night they issue out to seek their food and they'll eat anything after which they drag themselves towards some lake spring of water or river in order to drink by the emotion in this way along the shore and their vast weight they make a deep impression as if a heavy beam has been drawn along the sands and that's certainly what crocodile slipways look like if you've seen him somewhere like Central Australia yeah those are the bits to avoid if for some reason you're walking near without water crocodiles slide I wouldn't recommend it Japan to think about Asian dragons we think they fly without thinking about it and they do but the overwhelming majority of dragons Oriental dragons are associated with the water or deluge or underneath the water if there's actually a dragon king palace under the sea in Japan and that's this guy ujin's palace Naga interestingly is one of the Japanese words for dragons say he's almost starting to see I think in the cultures surrounding South East Asia an echo of an event a memory of something that's happened that was then incorporated into local landscape and space weather and so on now we get to the earliest layer that we can find archaeologically Jing Gong rock culture probably but definitely hong shang pig dragons and these were used as grave goods these dates pretty much correlate with at least one of the cultural movements of the coast from Southeast Asia but it looks very oberus doesn't it's got a pig head sure but that dragon is eating its damn tail and that is 8,000 years ago well between six and eight thousand years ago which comes which means we come to as I'm talking about the shape and typology of stories there's a Harvard has a indologist called dr. witzel and he has a book called the origins of the world's mythologies which is amazing and basically lower Asian mythology according to him his 40,000 years old then you have a Gondwana as an earlier layer and then he's got a hypothetical one called Pan gyein the Asian mythology he calls our first novel and it's sort of a stretch from North Africa through Eurasia and into the Americas everything underneath it Gondwana is like sub-saharan Africa potentially the bottom like davidic tip of India PNG and Australia now the broad shape of this is is probably correct I think he's under estimating and I'll come unto why just how many pieces have Gondwana mythology emerged into the Ragin mythology but once it's once it's set once it becomes this novel and he traces the movements of I think this lower asian story our story very successfully around the world and the lower asian myth is the creation of the world to its destruction so creation of father heaven mother earth you get those generations of monsters that's the next bit heaven is pushed up separation of sky enough killing of a dragon the flood is punishment for hubris and tricks today he's bring culture so that's the shape that you find that he thinks was put together around 40,000 years ago based on what he called a forest of stories which was the sort of local tribal spirit stories that you get from gondwana that's where you find it everywhere by the way so the razor is probably the earliest we can date the dragon but I'm not convinced that it is the origin of the dragon it's definitely the origin of the Dragons story the fact that our Lu ragin story more often than not begins with the destruction of a dragon does imply perhaps that it's it's come from earlier now this is really interesting it you may have seen this in the summer but you'd be familiar with the Rainbow Serpent creating the earth with its movements at the Aboriginal story the summer the oldest religious ritual was discovered in Botswana a seventy thousand year old worship of a Python who created the earth with her movements so it's not a dragon because I said specifically that we weren't going to talk about the snakes but it may be her grandmother because if you think about that broad shape just picture a world map in your head that doctor whitsel was talking about that would time quite well with the first linguistic complexity then you see the movement down to Australia which was left alone until we found it and I'm your fault so sorry they still have this basic shape of the story and then anything from New Guinea up as a result of say the end of the Ice Age and migration kind of moved the remaining bits have gone to run a story into Laurasia so this is quite interesting I think that the dragon may well be the very very beginning or at least its grandmother may well be the very beginning of religious ritual enough so let's go conclusion wise so I hope we actually show that we can use history to find the dragon but more importantly I think we can use the dragon to find history because you can start to see how that calibrates where certain connections between cultures that have informed the Western mystery tradition come from and I think of it like in 1966 the CIA dropped light bulbs of virus into the subway events and then tracked it was about 2 million people that got sick but they were able to do that they did the same thing with paint and I think of dragons in that way that they can where they show up is an indication of some form of connection so and also please please take away a dragon is not just one thing I think magicians need to expand when we do these sort of explorations beyond a single explanation we go oh it's that on to the next thing that's very unsatisfying when you're talking about things that are hugely complex and evidently hugely old like a dragon so we need to expand but not so far that we lose sight of the subject completely because most definitively the dragon resists singular explanations but it more fiercely resists being anything you want it to be I think we need a little bit more discernment when we put these things together that's its gift though using the dragon as a yardstick we can expand sort of magical timelines beyond where we currently look at them and look for other connections between things that have informed the Western mystery tradition and I think that even if it doesn't change your practice at all it leads to a grander and more fulfilling worldview I kind of put this presentation together as a promise to the dragon I did the whole office ritual and a Welsh version of it at dienes Emrys last year and knowing or participating in this research for the last few years merely deepen that experience for me because the red dragon of Wales is definitely not a New Guinean crocodile but it is part of that it is part of that story and it's so much more profound when you can pull those connections together so thank you very much good question the dragon density is lower in sub-saharan Africa but they have well but Spina has snakes oh yeah dragon density is lower they still have them in sub-saharan Africa and funnily enough in North America they don't have many dragons in North America they have a few it's sort of medium density in South America obviously you've got Quetzalcoatl and that kind of thing but those are the two places that don't have much in the way of dragons at the newly layer like there are places where later cultural imports have have changed that slightly and there's probably medium density dragons there's less dragons as you go out into the Pacific as well sort of Melanesia has some but they also still have crocodiles but by the time you get to Polynesia and Fiji which I only get crocodiles have a rate about one every ten years obviously very lost and sick you don't get much in the way of dragons look I think I think well that's a good question because we're talking about the dating for instance of when people were in Egypt or the Nile Valley last night there is a carving at gobekli tepe that is a crocodile right that's ten thousand years ago Turkey's not known for its crocodiles so the memory of that has to have come from somewhere there are close to crocodiles to Turkey than New Guinea so it may well be a Nile crocodile I really mean that for some of the stories that informed oriental dragons I think some of them may have come from the fact that we had to deal with crocodiles in our food supply what we these cultures had to deal with crocodiles in the food supply I don't think necessarily the idea of a New Guinean crocodile went from the southeast to the northwest across the planet that's another presentation it's a very good question I would say the the current resurgence of dragons in a particularly real politic milieu which is why everyone finds Game of Thrones so satisfying other than the sexiness is is that
 it's like house of cards it is very satisfying to see in an Aristotelian understanding of theatre that that politics is just real poet it is a game of Thrones and I think I find it mythically significant that the dragons are involved in that yeah so I hope that is it I think that's what we're seeing I think the dragons are here because of a widespread dissatisfaction with political process yeah there's loads and if you what you want to do I mean if you wanted an informed speculation of the cosmology of people before the ice age I would get dr. Witt CIL's book and the origin of world pathologies because he does a very very good job the Eurasian story is kind of myth ice age but his speculation of the book he puts it all together and say okay I think at a time depth for two hundred thousand years this is maybe what our well he was take that for what it is he admits in the book by the way it's hugely ambitious and he's going to be wrong he's throwing it out there because it's sort of I think it's the biggest project in mythology since camel it's it's such a good book and it will time will not be very kind to individual pieces but the macro idea is something we we need to onboard in to esotericism yeah well I think this story I think the reason we talking about which Souls version of Gondwana was a forest of stories Eurasia was our novel I think someone who wanted to be king put that together I think it was the idea if you can describe the universe you can run it so did to your point the fact that Tiamat is female and so is the Rainbow Serpent in most tellings of the story I do interpret I do think there's things to those two things coincide really I think we may be lost an appreciation of female creation at that point that seems to happen to us repeatedly over history but yes I I think the lower asian story is very much about kingship and there are pieces that particularly for women I guess I'm not one there is value in looking at it that way and even approaching things like the dragon that way as a recovery because quite I think that is a import from Gondwana from that earlier layer into the razor that needs to be unpacked in a in a better way yep yeah they saw wine and the track yep 523 ad yeah well yeah the lion is one of those monsters the reason we also have lions are so popular in heraldry is like whales they were quite mythical no one knew what these things were they knew that they were in sort of brown parts of the world scary and sometimes biblical parts of the world so when people say a line it may not have looked like a lion but it may be what they thought it was I mean Elizabeth the first was given a narwhal horn and said it was a unicorn horn I was told that but how does she know I mean didn't see much for the world and shed this great big freakin horn so I agree but when they say it was a lion it could have been anything and that's kind of to the point which is whatever these phenomena are we interpret them in an almost scream memory way so cultures that have dragons will see dragons cultures that don't will see something else it doesn't mean that the phenomena isn't real it's sort of Jacques relays macro hypothesis it's in the interface with culture to these Mongolian events take on the shape that we see them as and I think the dragon is one of the deepest and most profound ways of having that kind of Negroni an interface so yeah yes I recommend to anyone doing the Home Office in some sort of ritualized form you can find it on my blog I'm just Google that it's a it's an ancient Greek dragon so it's basically it's I don't wanna call it Kundalini but kind of is it's sort of awakening dragon energy and I think there's tremendous mode in that it's intense but I think there's tremendous merit in that and the relationship between the magician and the dragon I think is Kundalini and the home office are versions of that where by encountering or absorbing or whatever it happens to be you do take on some of its power and I think that power is very early creation stuff which we were just talking about I think there's quite a potent piece of tech there that becomes even more potent when you give it its historical context so it's like a 5-line incantation which obviously repeat but that knowing that potentially we're talking about the time depth of 70 thousand years botswana suite or some questions Oh cephalopod okay so come on the 18th century from terms of sauce language to town French probably some sort of ability Jenny comes back and shoots it is that some sort of slang for possibly like the nationalist insurrection I think it I think it's probably more humble than that I think it's a older version of Australia I bet you the guy when he was overseas at war he was probably not lowborn doing so I which is the guy who allegedly shot the dragon was from a highborn family I think it was local politics I think by the time this story was recounted to this sort of Edwardian Englishman when he got to come out and show he would be able to point to the family that did it and I bet you they live in a big house so I think that's what the come oven story is I still think it's very sad I just find that really sad that it just decayed in the river and what you have to see that's awful but yeah I wouldn't go as far as that although the dragon is historically associated with it that's why I started with the flag incident in the 50s which is the visions we pulled out - that was cool yeah that's the thing and maybe know after I like the way my girl Ian is that it covers a physical and non-physical event that is actually happening I mean we get alien abductions less so now because half of them were military base but we get alien abductions and it's the same kind of fairy baby stealing thing and dragon eating babies is like a fairy stealing baby so it's some kind of phenomena that we interpreted it in this way it was I suspect would be a power play for the bishop again they ever give me young guys dragons I'd like to be Archbishop please and I'm sure again like they come out and go the drag is always there when people are on the make the church that is I just drank it's like life that's mainly yeah well there are in no point am I saying that the physical parts of a dragon are giving a crocodile I think these phenomena can manifest physically I mean you saw in the story of China it obviously dropped whatever that weather phenomenon was it dropped giant pearls and so these things have a physicality to them I doing I wouldn't deny that at all and I love the idea that there's a spear in the church that's cool there we go Winchell and you know Georgia explosions it could be because it's enjoyed is the sort of one of the more popular patron saints he's patron saint of about thirty places like Catalonia different parts of Syria in places where peasants are revolting as they inevitably are so yes that may well be certainly part of it and I think it would especially be talking about Joe Mannix it would typologically say to them I'm here to stomp you because if they have a positive association with the dragon which incidentally you're having ambivalent association with the dragon rather than positive before Christianity then it sort of became negative in the east you have a positive one moving up and I think there's an opportunity to sort of date where that bifurcation happened but yes I think in that case I think sin George was used because he was a Roman soldier and the Normans thought there were replacement Romans as does everyone who has an empire he was an old soldier who killed the dragon that is just ready-made for stomping on pagan peasants any other job let's try see chose most positions same companies thing so this is blastocyst authority of this soldiers ain't trying to that's for us as for us versus that the continuity Kotik I think I agree I mean I'm talking about how the dragon rots and George is used it that if that's what it means when you get into that sort of that period that it is Auto versus cash but I don't say that's political because it dumb order inevitably comes from having a king in the church how convenient so yeah it's a good point sin George there's another extra layer which is worth particularly for people a bit more going back looking at some George which is things like most of the people they never physically existed because he's a type as mug just said you get versions of that story elsewhere but what happened around the time was them when his church is now or when he's like protocol a burial place is in Syria it's actually it's obviously the mound it was originally called amount of like some kind of highborn warrior so people were leaving offerings at the tomb of a dead warrior who wasn't sinned George and I've got absorbed into this and George myth so there's some kind of dead King and warrior aspect to like an actual legit ghost that is worth playing with so we have like some sort of Syrian ghost warrior Saints fighting a dragon it's actually quite cool when you describe it that way yeah okay the dragon getting blessed elected and then getting pissed and then water standing up how what's the correlation how what was I hopefully with some flood myths the flooding is my area and some of them do not that many of them I mean inevitably there was flooding before the end of the Ice Age I do think in a lot of cases you can trace a memory of the end of the Ice Age in through mythology but it every time you see a flood it's not the end of the Ice Age and sometimes it is but in a lot of the dragon cases I think we may make the reasonable assumption based on the spread of them in Laurasia and the fact at the beginning of this lower Asian mythology starts at 20,000 years ago I think it happened and the flood happened whatever was 12,000 years ago so yeah I think the a lot of those stories predated I think it's more
 to do with how the universe is created out of the body of something older or the skull in in Polynesia in particular you get it's very home attic which is one of the ways I think it's quite interesting that we end up like the mind of God or an interpretation of consciousness it's the skull of or the whole body and then the skull becomes the stars so it's like the mind cosmos connection in in a tribal sense and I think that's the angle with what TM arts and all those sort of dragon types that the universe is built out of is I think it's a description of reality you
