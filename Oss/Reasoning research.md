- **Research with reasoning** - Equipped with search and coding capabilities, Perplexity’s Deep Research mode iteratively searches, reads documents, and reasons about what to do next, refining its research plan as it learns more about the subject areas. This is similar to how a human might research a new topic, refining one’s understanding throughout the process.
    
- **Report writing** - Once the source materials have been fully evaluated, the agent then synthesizes all the research into a clear and comprehensive report.
    
- **Export & Share** - You can then export the final report to a PDF or document, or convert it into a Perplexity
