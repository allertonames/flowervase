I've had a lot of end result images come through, you know, like a blend of smiles. But also some other impetus to not just set it up but to finish it, you know, do the publication and finish it. Because it's like something's been removed or threat of death is being made.

My learning process before was I had stress and overwhelming effect of completing the end before I'd gone with the basics. My learning has to now retract the end result into the filing system which will produce the end results. Get on with all the basics.

My relationship to these images, commands, duties, ideas, prophets, whatever you want to call them. My relationship to them is developing and I need to just rest with these ideas in my head without then talking about them to ruin them. keeping them in my personal project that, you know, nobody's no better, and keep that churning along the background as I
As I developed the social apparatus and skills involved with socializing people.

> a 19th century book

If you're dealing with public domain material, you can just upload to archive.org. They'll OCR the whole thing and make it available to you and everyone else. (If you got it from archive.org, check the sidebar for the existing OCR files.)

Copyright issues aside (e.g. if your thing is public domain), the galaxy-brain approach is to upload your raw scanned PDF to the Internet Archive (archive.org), fill in the appropriate metadata, wait about 24 hours for their post-upload format-conversion tasks to run automatically, and then download the size-optimized and OCR-ized PDF from them.

I've done this with a few documents from the French and Spanish national archives, which were originally provided as enormous non-OCRed PDFs but shrank to 10% the size (or less) after passage through archive.org and incidentally became full-text-searchable.

I did this very recently for a 19th century book in German with occasionally some Greek. The method that produces the highest level of accuracy I've found is to use ImageMagick to extract each page as a image, then send each image file to Claude Sonnet (encoded as base64) with a simple user prompt like "Transcribe the complete text from this image verbatim with no additional commentary or explanations". The whole thing is completed in under an hour & the result is near perfect and certainly much better than from standard OCR softwares.Research with reasoning - Equipped with search and coding capabilities, Perplexity’s Deep Research mode iteratively searches, reads documents, and reasons about what to do next, refining its research plan as it learns more about the subject areas. This is similar to how a human might research a new topic, refining one’s understanding throughout the process.

Report writing - Once the source materials have been fully evaluated, the agent then synthesizes all the research into a clear and comprehensive report.

Export & Share - You can then export the final report to a PDF or document, or convert it into a Perplexity
