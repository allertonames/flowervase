Tarot divination a scientific view

AS we shuffle the cards with a question in mind the universe unfolds 

Synchonicity from kirby surpirse and other studies show that peoples intentions can change the outcome, can change luck by up to 6% - this is significant to win at roulette. Beginners luck they call it.
The studies also show after a while the intention fades even when money is at stake. 

The intention from the question unfolds into the shuffling of the cards creating a pack that is primed to the shufflers intention. In this quantum state the cards are like a complex Schrodinger cat.

Many spread have different aspects
The celtic cross goes
Heart of the mater - 
The opposing factor
Root Cause – foundation of the current situatution 
Known Influences – beleifs, or aspirations
Past influences – that still affects now
New circumstances – to come into your life
How you see your self
Surrounding enviroment
Guidance – what to focus on or what to avoid
Outcome – lesson to learn 

So a death card in one position will have a different interpretation in a different.

The turn of the card collapses the wave function to reveal the right card in right position for the individual.

Each card has key words and images which trigger the thought process in the mind to help them with there concern or question.
