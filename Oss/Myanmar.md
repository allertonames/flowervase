Myanmar as part of a heros journey	

There are only a couple of fully closed countries like north Korea. There also no go countries like Iran, and theres countries that have recently opened to outside tourist Cuba, Brunei, Tibet, and very recently Myanmar. 

The military dictatorship didn’t encourage visitors but it was possible, a couple of friends visited about 10 years ago and its still getting the basics up and running, I find it hard to imagine what it was like back then. 

In 20xxxx tourist were more welcome and I could see the infrastructure developing to accommodate the tourist money but the people and culture of the people slowly slowly go through the birth pangs from the incubation from heavily restricted borders to empire of the west infiltration 

 Culture clash 

The old downtown of the previous British rule give way to the local populace setting up shop on the kerbs and pavements outside the derelict, bordered up run down empty colonial buildings. 
Life and living goes on people drink tea, chew the beetlenut, eat food and entrepreneurs line up to sell enough to sustain themselves.

This is modern stone age living, if all the trappings of our modern age electrics, fuel for machines, telecommunications dissapered tomorrow places like myanmar would hardly flinch unlike the total chaos  the west would experience. 

The food and cuisine hasn’t changed much and is resilient to the regular stone age conditions 
The literal street food is a far cry from the trendy pop-ups of gleaming hygiene we associate in the west. Even the street food vendors in places like Thailand are still an age away from the basic subsistence living in downtown Yangon.

Fresh meat included all parts of the animal, guts innards, feet, neck etc. the better bits obviously going to the class above. Lots of dried protein in the form of dried fish bits or whole little ones. Dried strips of meat which would be mixed with some sort of chili paste and plain rice was the staple food. 

I walked through an old market place, well I say that but it was a building that could easily have been a nice shopping type mall from colonial times, anything except subsistance liviing items were gone. It was more of a warehouse with pallets of basic commodities stacked on the floor and sold buy the kilo or box. 

Shirtless scrawny men would hump and dump the purchases to waiting vehicles and hand pulled barrows. 

It’s a great demonstration of the ingenuity of the people, external factors force change and adjustments.   

In stark contrast I find a small area where it seems the middle class and foreign workers have their condo’s there is a cross roads as the central hub of western style coffee shops and pizza places.


How did it affect me

Similar to my first visit to india I was humbled by the poverty and appreciated the comparative luxury I enjoyed. I make my adjustments to the standard of living 

What really set it apart for me was visiting the main pagoda on a Sunday maybe it was busier than usual as it was the harvest full moon and a big celebration.

The Pagoda grounds was a focal point of the community – Imagine a huge cathedral that incorporated a large social space for families to enjoy a day out like at a park. 

Families would take food and ground sheets to enjoy worship, a picnic and a sleep, for young courting couples it was where they got some time together and to meet the others family. Everyone was in Sunday best dress well most some of the boys dressed in what was there latest fashion rather than the elegant traditional dress the ladies wore.

It’s hard to describe the common focus, cultural norms and traditions contributed at this material level contributed to a non material feeling that the spirits they honored were present. 

I spoke to tourist who couldn’t fathom the giving of money and the gold plated everything when they assume the people couldn’t fill their belies with food. A materialist point of view!
They don’t see the bigger picture that the Temples acted as Orphanage, school, Hospital, police, court system and focal point for their ancestors and higher spirit beings to interact – intercede and bestow blessings which at some point on death they hoped to join. 
Giving to the temple was the same as investing in the future and would literally provide food and shelter to those in need – a form of social security.

Mixing in the presence of these spirits, allowing the spirits attached to me to loose themselves in this ancestor soup, I felt like I lost spiritual weight while there, perhaps they could get a release, get lost, a holiday or an escape depends on the spirit and their attachments  to me. 

Bagan 
The old capital where only the brick built temples remain. Even to today as I saw from the slow train to Bagan and back, houses are temporary structures built from bamboo, banana leaf or the like which will go back to nature soon after they are abandoned.
There are 2 types of temple the small stupa probably for a small village and the big temples built by the royals or high class, they were scattered around in roughly the same proportion you would find temples in large cities in thailand and Laos. 
Most range from 900-650 years old similar to the times the empire in Cambodia was at it’s peak the whole region must have been the pinnacle of human development at the time
