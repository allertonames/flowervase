Hello folks,

I‚Äôve tried several PKMs but so far Logseq seems to stick the best, the low ‚Äúfriction‚Äù it has really works for me.  
One thing I like to make for myself is a cheatsheet that I add as favorite, and I use it (in conjunction with templates) as a reference.

It‚Äôs a mixed bags of ‚Äú(My) best practice‚Äù, Plugins & markdown documentations

The outcome looks like this, raw page is below

Raw file

```rust
icon:: Ôâä

- Page properties
	- To set properties for a page, you MUST use the first block
	- properties name must be without spaces. e.g. `Hebrew Name::` is bad, but `Hebrew-name::` is fine
	- `icon::` for setting a page icon
	- `alias::` is a way to call the same thing with different names.
	- `page-type::` to inherit icon e.g. [[locations]] and should be used a general type.
		- e.g. Mcdonalds is `page-type:: [[Locations]]` but it's `type:: [[Restaurant]]`
		- page-type is always pages (with [[]]) while type doesn't have (but still can).
	- `type::` is "like a subset" of `page-type::` it can also be set to a block. and it's "more detailed version of" page-type
	- `tags::` is a way to tag a block/page.
		- should I use `#` with tags? how does this work?
	- you can link property value with ``[[]]``, e.g. `birthday::[[10.06.1995]]`
- Use # for statuses and people
	- `#delayed` tasks
	- `#[[Or Gaist]]`
- TODO:
	- use `/TODO` to make a new task
	- you can add `/scheduled` or `/deadline`
	  :LOGBOOK:
	  CLOCK: [2023-11-17 Fri 20:57:34]--[2023-11-17 Fri 20:57:35] =>  00:00:01
	  CLOCK: [2023-11-17 Fri 20:57:35]
	  :END:
	- Add a progress bar with `{{renderer :todomaster}}` or `/todo master`
		- {{renderer :todomaster}}
- Kanban:
	- `/kanban`
	- [ReadMe](https://github.com/sethyuan/logseq-plugin-kanban-board/blob/master/README.en.md)
- namespaces
	- use `/` at the name of the file to use it as folder structure.
	  e.g. `[[Germany/Berlin]]`

I made one as well and reference it fairly often, less so over time as more things become intuitive. I use the same principle as I do for studying for school though, which is that a cheat sheet should not have things you know on it. Stuff like /TODO or icon:: is very intuitive and easy to remember, so if you‚Äôre not looking at the cheat sheet when you do those things, don‚Äôt put them on it. Keep it to the stuff that you always find yourself pondering, ‚Äúugh, how does that work again?‚Äù For me, that was mostly query syntax and hot key shortcuts. Once something is intuitive, I remove it from my cheat sheet. The less stuff on it, the easier it is to find what you need, minimizing time wasted scrolling past stuff you know.

Similarly, if you want keep everything, it might help to add some sub-headers and order the sections & content in sections by what you reference most often, so things you look up a lot are top of the list and stuff you don‚Äôt need reference for is near the bottom.

For the question about tags, what I‚Äôve seen most often is using brackets for in-line writing and hashtag for more traditional tagging. For example:

[![IMG_3154](https://discuss.logseq.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/3/354cd6d42cab80ebd01069fbd9f14bc488695f4a_2_690x139.jpeg)

Body modification is in brackets because it naturally fit in the sentence, but I had some other pages I wanted this article to be linked for reference, so tossed on some tags. Basically, the hashtag here is the equivalent of ‚Äòthis is also related to‚Äô. I also have a few utility tags (#to-read, #to-watch, etc.) that I only ever use as tags because the page itself isn‚Äôt a topic, it‚Äôs just a way of aggregating links. In the end, it‚Äôs a stylistic choice, so go with what feels intuitive to you.
