In the olden days, the majority of higher-level Daoists did not walk around wearing fancy clothes of a special cut and with a high hat, as hotshot Confucians, ceremonial Daoists, or Buddhists commonly did. Rather the ones who were generally known as being really high-powered people would often appear dressed in simple clothes, maybe even rags with holes in them. They did not care if they looked poor, average, or even below average. This was simply because they did not want to be bothered and did not feel they had any face to lose or gain.

Daoists commonly say, “If words do not serve you, it is better you do not use them.”

Chapter 18 
Great Dao neglected,
There emerges benevolence and righteousness.
Learning and erudition professed,
There emerges great artifice.
The six elements of kinship are not in harmony,
There emerges family duty (filial piety) and devotion.
The nation disordered and in upheaval,
There emerge patriotic ministers.

What does it mean to behave like melting ice? It means to continuously let go of your ego’s solidity. Forget about the heat that agitates the molecules, just think about when an ice cube melts. It lets go of its form, as it goes from being solid to being liquid. Similarly, as best as you can, yield to both what is inside of you and situations outside of you. If you think that there is something you can do about it and you can affect it, fine. 
Otherwise, if you cannot, just yield to the inevitable.

In cultivating your soul and vitality to Embrace the One,
Can you avoid separation?
In gathering your breath to become soft,
Can you be like an infant child?
In cleansing and polishing your profound perception,
Can you be without blemish?
In loving the people and governing the kingdom,
Can you be without cleverness? (Can you be wuwei/without action?)
In opening and closing the Gate of Heaven,
Can you be feminine?
In illuminating clarity to penetrate the four directions,
Can you be effortless (wuwei)?
Give life to things, nurture things,
Give life, but do not possess,
Act, but do not take credit,
Lead, but do not dominate.
This is called the Mysterious Dao

Chapter 6
The Valley Spirit never dies,
It is called the Mysterious Female.
The Mysterious Female,
Its gate is called the origin of Heaven and Earth.
Perpetually continuing, always endures,
Its use is effortless.

Tao Te Ching : 38  

The Master doesn't try to be powerful;
thus he is truly powerful.
The ordinary man keeps reaching for power;
thus he never has enough.

The Master does nothing,
yet he leaves nothing undone.
The ordinary man is always doing things,
yet many more are left to be done.

The kind man does something,
yet something remains undone.
The just man does something,
and leaves many things to be done.
The moral man does something,
and when no one responds
he rolls up his sleeves and uses force.

When the Tao is lost, there is goodness.
When goodness is lost, there is morality.
When morality is lost, there is ritual.
Ritual is the husk of true faith,
the beginning of chaos.

Therefore the Master concerns himself
with the depths and not the surface,
with the fruit and not the flower.
He has no will of his own.
He dwells in reality,
and lets all illusions go.

As the continuum continues, what will count will not be the specifics of exactly what you do or do not do. Those will be lost in the sands of time and the changes that will never cease. Rather, what will count will be the state of mind and the awareness you engaged when you exercised or did not exercise sincerity.

Chapter 7
Heaven constant, Earth permanent,
Heaven and Earth, the reason they can be constant and permanent is because they do not exist for themselves,
Hence they exist forever.
Thus, the sage places himself behind, but finds himself in front,
Excludes himself, and the self is preserved,
Is this not because he has no self-interest?
Therefore, the self can be fulfilled.

What Daoists see as a true act of humility is simply to recognize that you do not know what you do not know; and to recognize that there are things you cannot know while recognizing what can be known. It is great that lots of things can be known, but there is a lot that cannot be known. Humility recognizes the difference.

Benevolence and righteousness are basic Confucian ideas and, in a cheeky way, are mostly refuted by all the lines of this chapter. Likewise, from learning and erudition, there emerges great artifice. In one sense, this is descriptive of what some lawyers do in modern times. They often pervert the spirit of law and Dao, and then skillfully work out the words that are necessary to implement their goals. Artifice, trickery, using intelligence to manipulate viewpoints, making things appear to be what they are not – all of that is done to shift one set of words for another, and to shift all the emotional, mental, and psychic meanings that are attached to those words.

Chapter 19
 Abandon sageliness, discard erudition,
The people will benefit a hundredfold.
Abandon benevolence, discard righteousness,
The people will return to devotion (filial piety) and affection.
Abandon craftiness, discard profit,
Thieves and robbers will disappear.
These three cultural conventions are not enough.
Therefore, let the people follow these:
Recognize simplicity, embrace purity,
Reduce self-centeredness, diminish desires.

Daoists say it is good to dispassionately recognize the different parts of ourselves. This is so that you can dissolve the different parts of yourself which are essentially problematic, and which lead you away from the Dao and toward being dominated by the Mind of Man. It is not only political advice. Laozi is absolutely proposing that, if needed, all these parts within ourselves have to be negotiated and resolved through Emptiness, otherwise your essence will forever elude you.

Chapter 15 
The ancient masters who excelled in practice were those who were subtle, spiritual, mysterious, and penetrating,
So profound it cannot be understood,
Truly for this reason, they cannot be known.
Therefore, we try to describe their demeanor:
Deliberate in action, like crossing a winter stream.
Oh, vigilant! Like being alert to the four directions,
Oh, courteous! Like a guest,
Oh, yielding! Like ice beginning to melt,
Oh, simple! Like uncarved wood,
Oh, open! Like a valley,
Oh, opaque! Like murky water.
Who can make the murky water, by stillness, gradually become clear?
Who can make the inert, by long-lasting movement, gradually become alive?
Those who embrace the Dao do not seek excess,
Because they are not in excess.
Therefore, they can grow old without needing to be restored to perfection.

“The teacher takes you to the gate.” That means they teach you what it is and what to do until, through practice, you arrive at its reality. The line continues, “…but only you can walk through it”; that is, success and abilities come from your own effort, your own heart and mind working through the material, from beginning to the end, and thereby resolving any confusion you might have had about any implications. The Buddha gave similar advice. An individual has to go through the work of peeling back the layers. Unlike information, wisdom cannot be bought; it must be earned.

What we call “I” or “me,” whatever that is, could be just a way for your mind to gel coherently together for communication purposes. As the ten thousand identities unify into a single, coherent face, it gives a person a very solid sense of “This is who I am.” In truth, many of the identities are just conglomerations of extrapolations and memories. They are not actually what the person is, nor even necessarily what the person deep down thinks about themselves. But Daoists are very clear that your personal essence or the essence of any human being is beyond conscious thinking. It is beyond what you think about yourself, and even beyond that ground from which the ability to think about yourself derives.

The Daoists say, “Look to what is primary, not to what is secondary or tertiary.” Ideally, Daoist sages should not deliberately try to impress people. If anything, they should deliberately try to avoid directly influencing people unless asked. To have an influence on someone is to take away a certain amount of their free will. This is another aspect of “Leave no footprints.” It is only through free will that you can choose to leave behind the Mind of Man and move toward the Mind of Dao. If you simply manipulate the Mind of Man, you are guaranteed to stay within the Mind of Man, and you will not be capable of arriving at the Mind of Dao.

This fine point is also a big difference between Daoists on the one hand, and Hindus or Buddhists on the other. In Indian traditions, the guru is the human being who can lead you into the light. While it is also true that a genuine Daoist immortal or master can also lead you into the light, in Daoism the emphasis is more on the student choosing to follow the path, rather than relying on the master leading the student by the hand. Daoists say the master can take you to the gate (transmit all necessary instructions),but your success is determined by your own effort and diligence. However, for each authentic master that can do this, there are many who cannot, and who will instead lead you down blind alleys or “side gates,” as the Chinese call them. These are side paths that take you everywhere, but to awakening. Maybe they can take you to some nice places, which you may like or hate, but not to the Mind of Dao. Many things can impress. Special powers can. In the ancient Indian texts, some spiritual practitioners were said to have what are called siddhi or paranormal powers. For example, they were supposed to be able to walk through walls, read people’s minds, have people rise from the dead, and so on.

Daoists say you should not be too enamored by internal or external images in your mind. It is better to look at what is hidden twenty levels below the initial image. Ask yourself what any internal image actually is, where it leads you initially, and in which ways and how it influences you. Focus on where it is likely to take you at the end of the day. Are your internal images moving toward the endless circles of the Mind of Man? Or can they take you toward Emptiness and the Mind of Dao?

Chapter 20 

Abandon learnedness, discard rituals, and the people will lose anxiety.
Between yes and no, how much difference is there?
Between good and evil, how much difference is there?
What other people fear, one cannot fail to fear.
Alas! A desolation without end!
People are joyous and merry,
As if enjoying a great feast,
As if climbing the terraces in spring.
I alone am still! As one not yet revealing any signs,
Like a baby who has not yet smiled.
Weary and tired! As though without a home to return to,
Most people have plenty, but I alone seem lacking.
I am a man with the heart of a fool, ignorant! Blank!
Common people are bright and intelligent,
I alone am dim and dull.
Common people are
smart and discerning,
I alone am withdrawn and unobtrusive.
Placid! Like the sea,
Blowing about! As though without anchor.
Most people have purpose,
Yet I alone am awkward, seemingly unrefined.
I am only different from others,
Because I cherish nourishment from the Mother.

Laozi; Frantzis, Bruce. Daodejing: The Oral Tradition (p. 407). Energy Arts. Kindle Edition.

Find compassion and Emptiness within yourself. The idea of compassion is expressed by the most repeated phrase in the Yijing, “There is nothing that does not further.” This allows you to take the usual self-centered way the Mind of Man functions and refocuses it toward helping others. This is done not just for the good of individuals that you know, but for the larger good that may come out of it whether or not you share in it. This said, compassion has a flip side, a problem called “intelligence.” This is because compassion can be either intelligent or stupid. Intelligent compassion, besides having the genuine intent to help, also considers the consequences downstream of the compassionate intervention. Stupid compassion, influenced or reinforced by an individual’s neurosis, does not share this quality. The compassionate cure can become worse than the original problem or behavior, regardless whether the situation is physical, emotional, or mental. Giving a child a loaded gun, so they can defend themselves against whoever, can result in the child shooting themselves or an innocent bystander. 

...

Human intelligence is what creates all the “shoulds,” “woulds,” “musts,” and “oughts” in the first place, and these can go to war with each other. When compassion becomes stupid, although you may have some well-meaning, grand idea of doing something good, the poor use of intelligence in implementing the compassion can cause the actual outcome to be a total mess. Good intentions get side-tracked and the results are not good. As in the phrase, “The disease was cured, but the patient died.”

Laozi; Frantzis, Bruce. Daodejing: The Oral Tradition (p. 423). Energy Arts. Kindle Edition.

A mind that is capable of being dim, dull, withdrawn, unobtrusive may also be one filled with stillness and Emptiness, and the usefulness of this has been repeated many times in this text. Again, we have returned to the “heart of a fool.” What Laozi is saying here is, “Maybe you went to an Ivy League school or some equivalent, are bright and intelligent, and possibly even perceived by others as being quite something. For me, it is the values of the Mind of Dao that dominate me, rather than the values of the Mind of Man. I alone am dim and dull, I am not a big deal, I am not smart, in fact I am not much of anything. I can just perceive reality as it is! While smarter people are discerning in the ways of yin and yang, I am withdrawn. Although conventionally intelligent, I am no longer dominated by conventional yin and yang, and instead I am focusing on the world of Taiji, of Wuji. I am unobtrusive. I am engaged in the Dao’s larger reality, but not so much in the worldly reality dominated by implementing the ways of yin and yang.” He is pointing to the fact that the Mind of Dao can not only bring forth everything that occurs in the Mind of Man, but also much more than that.
