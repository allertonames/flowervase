There’s 2 type of people on the planet – Those who know there’s 2 types and those who don’t 

They walk amongst us

More and more evidence is building from various sources and from numerous places around the planet that show on the balance of probabilities that there was an advanced civilization before the last big cataclysm of around 12,000 years ago, and that these civilizations could have stretched back to 30-40,000 years ago in various forms and probably with some gaps.

With this in mind, the Nag Hamadi codices and some passages in the bible supports the existence of a pre-deluvian peoples. The creation myth from the Bible talks of the earth transforming from a dark lifeless rock into a garden like paradise filled with a balance of nature which includes all animals species and humans within the 6 day period. ‘Day’ is to be taken as a period of time that each process took, it could be millennia it could be aeons, don’t get hung up on the specifics, the overall sequence matches logical steps from the lifeless rock to complex life and considerably different to other creations myths of similar age like the churning of the milk sea by Naga the snake.

In the original Hebrew the word Elohim is used for God in the creation myth up to Gen 2:4 where it switches to “Lord God” or Jehovah God. Therefore the bible does document the difference in the formation of life on earth and the formation of the latest iteration of civilization. 

Genesis 1: In the beginning Elohim created heaven and earth. Names of God Bible (NOG)

24 Then Elohim said, “Let the earth produce every type of living creature: every type of domestic animal, crawling animal, and wild animal.” And so it was. 25 Elohim made every type of wild animal, every type of domestic animal, and every type of creature that crawls on the ground. Elohim saw that they were good.
26 Then Elohim said, “Let us make humans in our image, in our likeness. Let them rule the fish in the sea, the birds in the sky, the domestic animals all over the earth, and all the animals that crawl on the earth.”
27 So Elohim created humans in his image. In the image of Elohim he created them. He created them male and female. 28 Elohim blessed them and said, “Be fertile, increase in number, fill the earth, and be its master. Rule the fish in the sea, the birds in the sky, and all the animals that crawl on the earth.”

Elohim is plural – also note the “Let us” in vr 26 – In this context it is reference to the unknowable creative force, the all, the one, the power over the lower gods. The God above gods.
 
The key point is that the Elohim created man and woman as part of the original (6day) balanced planetary creation. The 6th day man and woman are called pre-adamic in many places and they will be hereon-in.

Along came an impostor
Imagine if you will the 7th day in of rest in Genesis 2:3 was a culmination of all the legends of the golden ages in a paradise like garden that we read of in the Kali Yuga sagas and Greek legends
"Golden Age" denotes a period of primordial peace, harmony, stability, and prosperity. During this age peace and harmony prevailed, people did not have to work to feed themselves, for the earth provided food in abundance. They lived to a very old age with a youthful appearance, eventually dying peacefully, with spirits living on as "guardians". Plato in Cratylus (397 e) recounts the golden race of humans who came first.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Age

There is a very long time and a lot going on between Gen2:3 and Gen 2:4.
The Golden age ended from one but probably more world wide cataclysms. – the causes are for others to debate.
On the balance of probabilities the Saturn Theory along with legends of Venus being a fierce comet that brought fiery death from the skies are the most likely candidates for the last remembered and documented (albeit some in rock art) cataclysm.

The thunderbolts project does a great job of detailing the world wide common themes of separation of Heaven from earth, cataclysms from falling skies and ultimately the fall of Pre-adamic man from life in the garden paradise to subsistence survival in a new harsher environment. It describes how the earth (with pre-admic man on it) moved out of the protective glow of the Saturnian magnetosphere into a new position in the solar system where the inorganic plasma energy entities the Archons are now able to access the planet and life on it. (more details to follow) 

It’s at this point Genesis 2:4 picks and Jehovah appears on the scence (“YHWH” Yahweh, Yaldeboath) whatever label you want but ‘he’ is the demiurge the impostor, the chief Archon. 

Genesis 2:5 Wild bushes and plants were not on the earth yet because Yahweh Elohim hadn’t sent rain on the earth. Also, there was no one to farm the land. 6 Instead, underground water would come up from the earth and water the entire surface of the ground. 7 Then Yahweh Elohim formed the man from the dust of the earth[a] and blew the breath of life into his nostrils. The man became a living being.
American standard version gives us similar
5 and no plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for Jehovah God had not caused it to rain upon the earth: and there was not a man to till the ground; 6 but there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground. 7 And Jehovah God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.
There were no workers to develop the land, Pre-adamic man also reflected in indigenous cultures to this day had a substance type of living and somewhat of an immunity to the mind machinations of the Archons. 
A parallel account in The Secret book of John says 
Yaldabaoth said to his subordinate demons:
            “Let’s create a man according to the image of God, And our own likeness
             So that his image will illuminate us.” 
They made a creature of substance, In the likeness of that perfect First Man
And they said, “Let us call him Adam, so that his name will give us the power of light.”

Then it goes on to say 

All of Yaldabaoth’s servants and his demons. Worked to finish the psychic body.
            For a very long time it lay inanimate, It did not move.
	They told Yaldabaoth:
            “Blow some of your Spirit in the man’s face, Then his body will rise up.”
Yaldabaoth blew some of his Spirit into the man.
            That Spirit was the divine Power of his mother. 
[He didn’t understand what was happening, for he lived in ignorance.]
His mother’s divine Power left Yaldabaoth It entered the psychic human body Modeled on the primordial image. 

The human body moved! It grew powerful! It shone! 


To summarize the Chief Archon Jehovah saw for them there were no workers and no one to illuminate them, this is generally taken as worship but can also be taken as for them to incarnate within and indulge in earthly material pleasures.  
So they made Adamic man as a slave race to work for them by copying the perfect creation but it remain lifeless and was only animated after Jehovah gave him the “breath of life” being a living soul (note it’s described as living therefore it means it can die) this power came from Jehovah’s mother/creator later on identified as Sophia

Pre-adamic and the slave race Adamic man created by Jehovah are the same on a material level, they differ on the immaterial level. Pre-admics are endowed with a divine spirit from source (perfect, whole) and Adamics are only animated by the living soul from the divine power of the creator of Jehovah. 










Firstly we see Jah has a spirit not a soul, Spirit is divine power direct from the ALL / ONE

Psychic in this context comes from the 3 division of either preadmic or adamic which are
Psychic – Soul /Mind – the body that holds the living soul
Hylic - of matter- concerned only with the material world, have lost the  
Pnematic – Spirit – Matter dwelling spirits. (pre-adamic – but these can fall and be overwhelmed by the material world they are like Hylics) 

differentiating the 3 types is also for another time

Adamic creation are lead to believe that their creator is the best and they are also the best, superior to whatever came before.
AS we have established animals and pre-admic man were created together and are coming from the same source adamic man view themselves as the only things with a  god given soul (yes they are right about this) but erronously they presume animals and pre-admic are like meat with no divine connections so it is perfectly ok to treat pre-adamic man like they treat animals. 
This point of view is tainted and one sided, similar to the well know point that history is written by the victors. 


 
Those thieves bound the man in it, Enchained him in forgetfulness, Made him subject to dying.
In order to recover the Power that he had put into Adam. Yaldabaoth made Adam completely forgetful. 

In a system engineered to be materialistic that absolutely refutes any type of intelligent people before Adamic, denies any type of immaterial or spirit realm and will fiercly defend that position. 

that if the earth is the material realm than the immaterial is the ‘heaven’ that separated from earth when the ‘fall’ happened. Its been quarantined and access denied by the archons or discovery of it would pull the rug from beneath their feet. 

So we now have the great struggle, good v evil them vrs us but the waters have been so muddied and  stirred that it’s practically impossible tell from within this sludge (trust me if your reading this your in the sludge) who is who, who is good who is bad even to the extent of who you or I am. 

The mud is settling and some light can be glimpsed, significant findings and work has established on the balance of probabilities – YHWH is the demiurge of the current civilization that has been trying to kill off any and all indigenous heritages and icloud the judgment of any others so the Archons can trick the pre-adamic into handing over their sovereignty and planet similar to the land grabs of the empirical powers.

With the recent discoveries and clarifications via Nag hamadi etc we can logically surmise a different history, a different creation, a different cosmology, it them remains to find out where we as individuals are within it.

Check Gen 3:22 for jah must send down man for becoming like him




From the perspective of the people who were here before the last set of cataclysm the indigenous peoples. 

The planet and all natural life is from a higher source than the demiurge. It is perfectly created, animals  and people have a divine spirit which is part of the planet as a whole. Sue to the catacylsm the fall etc the divine seed in nearly all has been in hibernation waiting for germination.

The perfect man – pre-adamic doesn’t need a soul they have immortal divine spirit. 

Senitnel animals – elephant dolphins orangutans whales etc live in harmony with the planet, seem to have a animating s spirit, we now recognize them as having a wisdom that humans lack. Empathy for their dead and even other species that puts many humans to shame. Even trees have an intelligence that is in harmony with their environment. So to call them worthless animals to be used and abused demonstrates the imperfection of Adamic man.

Pre-adamic are being gaslighted into submission and coerced into systems that remove their sovereignty and subjegate them to the machinations of the empire of archon (EoA)
