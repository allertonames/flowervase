The Age of Revealing
.
by Michael Tsarion
	

...the final goal of world revolution is not Socialism or even Communism, it is not a change in the existing economic system, it is not the destruction of civilization in a material sense; the revolution desired by the leaders is a moral and spiritual revolution, an anarchy of ideas by which all standards set up throughout nineteen centuries shall be reversed - Nesta Webster (Secret Societies and Subversive Movements, 1921)

Benjamin Disraeli, the first Jewish Prime Minister of Victorian Britain, wrote in his novel Coningsby: "The world is run by very different personages from what is imagined by those who are not behind the scenes."

Prime Minister Disraeli was obviously aware that our world is controlled by powerful secret societies and fraternal orders whose agendas and goals have little to do with our best interests. Although these orders do not necessarily conceal their identities, they do endeavor to conceal what goes on behind the doors of their various lodges and establishments. Elite members of the Alpha Lodges of Freemasonry do not wish to have information about their strange practices, rites and agendas publicly disclosed.

They manufacture many strategies and devices to ensure secrecy. As one Masonic author reveals:

	

Freemasonry is labyrinthine. It is full of puzzles, conundrums, misspellings, corruptions, cryptic clues, and simple salutes, childish codes, contrivances, circular paths, roads that sometimes lead nowhere, walls appearing to be ten feet thick yet giving way easily to the lightest touch in the right spot, riddles to be solved, numerous passwords, an allegorical, highly symbolical, double-entendre storyline worthy of the best latter-day spy writers, protected by secret signs and symbols and a myriad of enigmas to be confronted…In the labyrinth that is Freemasonry there is a center where rests its holy grail. Many have tried to find it only to reach dead ends - Leon Davin (The Ritual: The Greatest Story Never Told)

In The Irish Origins of Civilization I expose the true origins and agendas of the world’s most powerful secret societies. I also expose the origins and agendas of the religions that secret society elites have given birth to. We demonstrate how the arch-conspirators at the top of the power pyramid have expertly used both religion and politics to further their anti-human objectives. Essentially our work informs the reader of certain vital occult facts that are for the most part unknown to members of secret societies. For generations the true origins and agendas of the Masonic Order, Knights Templar, Rosicrucians and Illuminati have been carefully guarded secrets:
	

The Blue Degrees are but the outer court…of the temple. Part of the symbols are displayed there to the initiate, but he is intentionally misled by false interpretation. It is not intended that he shall understand them, but it is intended that he shall imagine that he understands them…The true explanation is reserved for the Adepts, the Princes of Masonry (those of the 32nd and 33rd degrees) - Albert Pike

These good folk swell our numbers and fill our money-box. Set yourselves to work; these gentlemen must be made to nibble at the bait…But this sort of people must always be made to believe that the grade they have reached is the last - Adam Weishaupt

Disraeli was not the only man to remark on the Machiavellian agendas of those who work to change the course of humanity's fate. In her voluminous but rambling writings, occultist and Fabian Alice A. Bailey explained the essentials:
	

Behind the division of humanity stand those Enlightened Ones whose right and privilege it is to watch over human evolution and to guide the destinies of men…This they do through the implanting of ideas in the minds of the world thinkers, so that these ideas in due time receive recognition and eventually become controlling factors in human life. They train the members of the New Group of World Servers in the task of changing these ideas into ideals. These in turn become the desired objectives of the thinkers and are then taught to the powerful middle class and worked up into world forms of governments or religion, thus ​forming the basis of the new world order

Naturally, the power-elites and their minions (who apparently believe the world to be their personal play-pen), have a great deal to lose should the underclasses learn about the psychic and social control that operates all around them, hidden in plain sight. However, the task of revealers is made considerably more difficult due to "consensus trance" and knee-jerk fear that inhibits a colonized mind. Servants of Truth know from experience how few friends are won when and if they endeavor to expose the dirty big secrets of religion’s upper echelon.

Nevertheless, a Servant of Truth is not permanently daunted by controversy or resistance. He is aware that one is much more likely to cut themselves with a blunt knife than a sharp one. He is aware that the cost of ignorance is ultimately far greater than the price paid for knowledge. He knows that freedom is never free and that silence is most definitely consent. He comes to realize that on the great board game of life, if he fatally chooses not to occupy the white squares of knowledge, he will be manipulated by those who will.  

      The only good is knowledge and the only evil ignorance - Socrates

Picture

The task of exposing the secrets of secret societies is somewhat complicated because it inevitably involves the exposure of the secrets of religion. And since religion is intimately connected to politics, the task cannot but include an exposure of the secrets of politics. Although it is vain to expect a single work to investigate all the dark highways and byways of these institutions, we can at least make a zealous start, and wait to see where the river of ink leads. 

Along the way, we bear in mind that it is not one torch we must light, and not a single shadowy labyrinth we must explore, but three. Like a newly initiated Masonic neophyte, we too must negotiate three steps toward truth and empowerment. May our destination be the same as that purported by Masonry. May our three lonely roads lead us to the altar of Truth. Truly it is not hyperbole to say that we are, during the years of this new millennium, going to experience the greatest of revelations concerning the most relevant human mysteries. We can expect many a layer of deception to finally be peeled away. Some of us may be glad and grateful for the coming light of revelation. Others among us may be startled by the proximity of such insight, while many will inevitably find themselves deeply threatened by its presence. Many will not wish to see in themselves the dirt that this special kind of light reveals.

.The Origins of Evil
	

It took man over a million years to progress from using stones as he found them to the realization that they could be chipped and flaked to better purpose. It then took another 500,000 years before Neanderthal man mastered the concept of stone tools, and a further 50,000 years before crops were cultivated and metallurgy was discovered. Hence, by all scales of evolutionary reckoning, we should still be as far removed from any basic understanding of mathematics, engineering or science - But here we are, only 7,000 years later, landing probes on Mars…So, how did we inherit this wisdom, and from whom? - Laurence Gardner     

Picture

In my book Atlantis, Alien Visitation and Genetic Manipulation, I reveal how evil came into the world and consciousness of human beings. I show how in prehistoric times our solar system was visited by alien beings, possibly from the star system Alpha Draconis.

These entities - whose biological and ideological descendants control the world governments and religions - did not come to this planet by choice. Their presence was known throughout the world by many sages who preserved the story of their arrival and deeds.

In Past Shock, Jack Barranger claims that over thousands of texts once existed containing information about the presence of alien beings on our planet. In our book we reveal how many modern top academics - such as Carl Sagan, Robert Oppenheimer, Herman Oberth, Frances Crick, Albert Einstein, Nikola Tesla and Fredrick Soddy - were open to the idea of alien intervention. I explained how the deliberate destruction of the vast ocean planet Tiamat - that once existed between Mars and Jupiter - precipitated the great deluge mentioned in the myths. And we revealed how these alien visitors came down to our planet, erected a headquarters on the now lost continent of Appalachia, and built the complex we know as Atlantis.

The empire of Atlantis stretched its tentacles to all the corners of the earth. One might say that the first draconian “World Order” experienced by humankind was Atlantean. Additionally, I reveal how the so-called Fallen Angels initiated a genetic hybridization program that lasted for centuries. In their nefarious experiments, human DNA was mixed with alien DNA. This nefarious act was to prove devastating to consciousness.

This program radically altered the course of earth history and had catastrophic effects on the quality of human existence. In my book I refer to the schizoid creature who emerged from these experiments as “Homo Atlantis.” He was the ancestor of every man and women in the world today. In effect, Homo Atlantis was created to act as a servant for the gods in the so-called "Garden of Eden." He and his kind were sent forth to labor at the behest of alien masters. Adam of Genesis was not an individual, per se, but a race of men.

The truth about the alien presence, origins of evil, and rise of secret societies could not be wholly and lucidly revealed during past centuries for the simple reason that the time was not right. Specifically, the astrological time was not right. In the present millennia, however, the time is right, and as a result many veils and masks are falling away. New revelations on all fronts cause us to radically alter the way we view our world. They alter our perception of history and explain the present state of decay.

.Apocalypse
	

During times of universal deceit, telling the truth becomes a revolutionary
act - George Orwell

Picture

As some ancient prophecies inform us, we have since the year 1999 been in the so-called “Age of Revealing.” This is a time of literal “Apocalypse,” when the masks of the false begin to come down. This period of cleansing and catharsis will be deeply threatening to morally unhygienic souls who have long profited from the ruin of their fellows. It is not good news for consummate narcissists who have personally advanced at the expense of the good people around them. The approaching endgame is especially threatening to those connoisseurs of power whose insatiable penchant for deception and destruction has contaminated our world. 

The enemy we face - which has haunted our world for millennia - will not concede of its own will. It will not yield or give ground. It is in fear, but has combined its fear with occult knowledge. This combination makes it lethal in the extreme. It seeks to humiliate the good, the pure, and the virtuous. It is the enemy of truth and freedom. It cannot triumph because the force it vainly opposes is eternal and self-sustaining.

The problem of evil is not solved with a clenched fist but open, receptive, mutable, insightful minds. These characteristics are represented by the Archangel Michael and his mighty sword, by Arthur’s Excalibur, Robin’s flaming arrows, and Merlin’s serpentine wand. We overcome the direst enemies with knowledge rather than might. We seek revelation to prevent revolution, and to overcome evil with the force of our example rather than the example of our force. We use psychological weaponry, and move with conviction in our cause with sovereign power. As said above, we understand that freedom is never free and that silence is most definitely consent.

	

Among my people are wicked men who lie in wait like men who snare birds and like those who set traps to catch men. Like cages full of birds, their houses are full of deceit; they have become rich and powerful and have grown fat and sleek. Their evil deeds have no limit; they do not plead the case of the fatherless to win it, they do not defend the rights of the poor - (Jeremiah 5:26)

Woe to you who call evil good and good evil: that put darkness for light, and light for darkness: that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter - (Isaiah 5:20)

John Lennon once predicted that his band - the Beatles - would become "more famous than Jesus." Given that his iconoclastic forecast included other candidates within the entertainment business, Lennon's prediction has actually turned out to be quite accurate. Although we may resist accepting it, today's youth could care less about Jesus and God. Those who appear to care do so because of parental indoctrination. Left to their own devices they prefer to choose Marilyn Manson and Snoop Doggy Dog as mentors and models. Perhaps they could care less about the Sacred Heart for good reason.

After all, what does it really matter if a special man of God walked the earth thousands of years ago? What does it matter that he had enemies, and that he sacrificed his life for what he believed? What does it matter that he had betrayers on his trail? What does it matter if he had magical powers to heal and reveal, or that he rose into heaven after his torture and death?

Actually, to a rational mind none of this matters at all. It works excellently as great tale, a ripping yarn, a Hollywood super-drama, and that is about all. Only the emotionally disturbed, psychologically infirm or intentionally malign have taken it to mean more than this. We do not need to recount the repulsive biographies or histories of so-called saints, kings, popes and evangelists, or reiterate the erudite theories of Freud, Jung, Reich and other psychoanalysts, to reinforce this truism. No, few care or have ever cared about the factuality of Bible stories. Subconsciously most people understand the improbability of Biblical stories. However, because our egotism is satiated and reinforced by such tales, many infantile or spiritually toxic humans continue to accept them as literally true. Truth can perish as long as there is no threat to animistic beliefs and infantile behavior. The world can come to ruin as long as illusory ideas of salvation by proxy are not threatened and dispelled.

Regardless of resistance, the time has come for us to decolonize minds and cleanse hearts. We must sharpen our discernment and see the lies before us. We must have zero tolerance for the lies and guts to seek for answers to each and every mystery. In short, we must painstakingly deconstruct the false beliefs that have infected the consciousness of millions.

Rebellion against the authorities attempting to undermine our psychic sovereignty constitutes service to the Holy Spirit. Indeed, rebelliousness is the hallmark of the Holy Spirit. Little wonder that Christians personify this Spirit of Rebellion as Lucifer the "Fallen Angel." Little wonder they obscure the significance of the Holy “Ghost,” and frown on outsiders who will not conform and wear their "mind-forged manacles."

	

It should never be forgotten that the power of the priest rests solely on the credence of the people. The people cry out for a savior, for certainty of heaven, for an exemption from the terrors of hell. Hence Priestcraft can neither do without hell nor purgatory. Take away both, or either, and its power is gone - M. F. Cusack (The Black Pope: A History of the Jesuits)

A religion which sedulously opposes its own improvement can do nothing essential toward improving anything else...On the contrary, it must check the growth of everything it touches with its palsied hands - Kersey Graves (The Bible of Bibles)

.Return to Selfhood
	

Whoever cannot find a temple in his heart, the same can never find his heart in any temple - Mikhail Naimy (The Book of Mirdad)

Although most Christians are loathe to accept it, it is consistent with esoteric doctrines to associate the Holy Spirit with individual consciousness. Stripped of its deceptive theological trappings, the Holy Spirit is simply a synonym for Selfhood. 

The Holy Spirit idea can be traced to Sophia or "Wisdom." It is equated with knowledge and love of knowledge. Although this knowledge certainly extends to God and his Son, it begins with Self-Knowledge. In other words, on one level Sophia implicitly refers to Knowledge of the Self.

The conspiring forces making Self-Knowledge taboo, who distort and complicate our understanding and veneration of the Holy Spirit, attempt to remove the Self from the Holy Trinity. To imagine the Holy Spirit as a vague presence, an indefinable aspect of the Virgin Mary, a white ethereal dove, an abstract metaphysical principle or inexplicable mystery, suits the priesthood. Their sleight-of-hand denies their flock the most valuable key to the gates of salvation.

It is the journey of Self-discovery that true mystics embark upon and that sincere philosophers aspire to. But this trek into the labyrinths of the Self was reprehensible to men drowned in dogma. The manufacturers of religion had to instill the wholly false notion that man receives enlightenment from without. The believer submits his will and self-reliance and obeys his masters. He must perform the rites prescribed for his spiritual welfare. His behavior and actions are to be overseen by the priests, whose existence depends on the unquestioning complicity of the "sinners" under their power. 

The "Holy Ghost" of the priesthood "descends" upon a man from outside. It does not awaken from within his own being. This false and dire doctrine was enough to throw man into the hands of deceivers seeking to rape him of his innate spiritual virtue. In truth, there is no enlightenment outside oneself. There is nothing worth attaining that does not originate within one's own being. If such a thing as "enlightenment" exists, we can be certain that it is never bestowed by gurus, priests or experts - breeders of selflessness and delusion. (Here for more...)
	

Do you deny me the entrance to heaven, I who have at last learned the mystery of myself - (Egyptian mystery school legend)

We cannot see through the eyes of any other person, and they cannot see through our eyes. They cannot share our perspective, regardless of whether such nonsense is commonly believed or not. Every faculty we possess is ours alone, and so is the intellectual understanding we gain through life. As the inscription at Delphi implied, it is only after a man has ended his inner division and come to rational clarity over the mystery of himself, that he can inherit wisdom:
	

Without father, without mother, without human descent; His life has neither beginning nor end; but, as the Son of God, abides as a Holy Priest continually - (Hebrews 7:3)

Many stand outside at the door, but it is only the solitaries who will enter into the bridal chamber - (Jesus Christ's words as recorded in the Gospel of Thomas)

As said, the knowledge of God, or even of the Son of God, is worthless to the man who does not know the ways of his own being.
	

 ...a distorted development of autonomy is the root cause of the pathological and, ultimately, evil element in human beings - Arno Gruen (The Betrayal of the Self: The Fear of Autonomy in Men and Women)

The most strongly enforced of all known taboos, is the taboo against knowing who or what you really are behind the mask of your apparently separate, independent, and isolated ego - Alan Watts (The Book: On the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are)

The individual has always had to struggle to keep from being overwhelmed by the tribe. If you try it, you will often be lonely, and sometimes frightened. But no price is too high to pay for the privilege of owning yourself - Friedrich Nietzsche

Alas, I can see that you do not know what it means to be alone. Wherever there have been powerful societies, governments, religions, or public opinions - in short, wherever there was any kind of tyranny, it has hated the lonely philosopher; for philosophy opens up a refuge for man where no tyranny can reach: the cave of inwardness, the labyrinth of the breast; and that annoys all tyrants - Friedrich Nietzsche (Schopenhauer as Teacher)

Picture

To burn down the bridge of Selfhood, hoping to reach the ship leaving for paradise, is to fall and drown in the cold, swirling, demon-infested depths of perplexity and insanity. “Self-Realization is necessary before God-Realization” was the motto of the Vedic sages. “Know Thyself” were the words found at the Delphic Oracle in Greece. The temple of the living God is “within” announced Jesus Christ. The message is simple: There is no enlightenment outside the Self. Man is his own priest and woman her own priestess. The cardinal misconception - that we receive our satori and our bliss from someone or something other than the Self - has achieved more than a reinforcement of the “master-slave” conflict.

This is the antithesis of the philosophy taught by the Druids and Arya of antiquity.

We understand that a rational man cannot say "I and my Father are one," unless he is as a man one to begin with. If we are psychosomatically dissociated, how can we possibly find "oneness" with God or anyone else? The Christian who imagines that being one with the Father implies the abnegation of Selfhood, is little more than a masochist. How can a mere nothing, a human zero, merge with God? After all who is it that comprehends this state of oneness, or more correctly wholeness? Logically it is only a Self that can merge with God's Self.
	

When you know yourselves, then you will be known, and you will know that you are the sons of the living Father. But if you do not know yourselves, then you are in poverty, and you are poverty - (Gospel of Thomas)

You yourself are even another little world and have within you the sun and the moon and also the stars - Origen (Church Father, 3rd Century AD)

You are the temple of God. For the temple of God is holy, which temple you are - (1 Corinthians 3:16)

The abnegation of Selfhood is tantamount to self-murder. Thanks to dogmatic antihuman religion, sadism toward the Self is rampant throughout the world. The institutions of the world, be they religious or political, exist to undermine psychic sovereignty and crush the Spirit of Rebellion. They are obscene contradictions to the Holy Spirit. The Church is not the agent of the Holy Spirit but its greatest enemy. A careful reading of the Bible reveals how many passages are given over to the issue of abject submission and slavery:
	

The man that will do presumptuously, and will not hearken unto the priest…even that man shall die - (Deuteronomy 17:12)

Slaves, submit yourselves to your masters with all respect, not only to those whose are good and considerate, but also to those who are harsh. For it is commendable if a man bears up under pain of unjust suffering because he is conscious of God…But if you suffer for doing good and you endure it, this is commendable before God - (Peter 2:18-21)

The same thing applies to the works of both Martin Luther and John Calvin. These two mentally deranged fanatics lived to see their irrational theological ideas infect entire nations. In their minds men were sinful worms worthy of eternal damnation. There was nothing man could do to change his fate because God had decided on a man's fate before his birth. Therefore total submission to God is man's prescribed lot.
	

For God wants to save us not by our own but by extraneous justice and wisdom, by a justice that does not come from ourselves and does not originate in ourselves but comes to us from somewhere else...that comes exclusively from the outside and is entirely alien to ourselves - Martin Luther (Vorlesung uber den Romerbrief)

Nor can you find any other remedy than do deny yourself and discard all selfish considerations, and to devote your whole attention to the pursuit of those things which the Lord requires of you - John Calvin (Institutes of the Christian Religion)

Once Selfhood is undermined we become docile and compliant. We do not exist for our own sake. We exist for God and the Church that acts in His name. We become putty in the hands of earthly demigods. Not surprisingly the same ministers of God who cajoled men to relinquish their sense of personal individuality also compelled them to obey earthly masters without question.

Indeed, the greatest confirmation of the truth of Selfhood is evidenced by the persistent denial of it by religion. We detect its supreme importance from the fervent irrational antipathy it elicits from the ideologues of theism:

	

Nothing is more poisonous, harmful or devilish than a man in rebellion - Martin Luther

...even if those in authority are evil or without faith, nevertheless the authority and its power is good and from God...therefore wherever there is power and where it flourishes, there it is and there it remains because God has ordained it - Martin Luther (Vorlesung uber den Romerbrief)

The very fact that the sword has been instituted by God to punish the evil, protect the good, and preserve peace…is powerful and sufficient proof that war and killing along with all the things that accompany wartime and martial law have been instituted by God - Martin Luther

His scintillating logic regarding the evils of monarchy is revealed in the following passage:
	

God would prefer to suffer the government to exist no matter how evil, rather than to allow the rabble to riot, no matter how justified they are in doing so...A prince should remain a prince no matter how tyrannical he may be. He beheads necessarily only a few since he must have subjects in order to be a ruler - (Against the Robbing and Murdering Hordes of Peasants)

We get the same psychotic refrain from Luther's successor John Calvin:
	

For I do not call it humility if you suppose that we have anything left…We cannot think of ourselves as we ought to think without utterly despising everything that may be supposed an excellence in us. This humility is unfeigned submission of a mind overwhelmed with a weighty sense of its own misery and poverty; for such is the uniform description of it in the word of God - (Institutes of the Christian Religion)

From these passages we see why the abnegation of Selfhood is subtly but deliberately enforced throughout the so-called "civilized" societies of the world. We see what kind of citizen is created and what kind of person. Indeed, it is the subjugation of Selfhood that has driven us perilously near to the gates of oblivion. Perhaps we now understand why it is that a man cannot be “forgiven” for sins committed against the Holy Spirit (or Higher Self). And perhaps we understand why it was so vitally important for early Judeo-Christian mythmongers to obscure the identity of this third party of the Trinity.
	

And so I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven - (Matthew 12:31)

Jesus said: “He who blasphemes against the Father will be forgiven, and he who blasphemes against the Son will be forgiven; but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either on earth or in heaven” - (Gospel of Thomas)

Remove the Self from the Trinity and your demonic schemes of domination succeed beyond your wildest expectations. Replace the Self in the metaphysic, and your malignant end is assured. Once the Self is brought back into the picture, however, we find that we can follow the bright Dove of Truth homeward to the sanctuary of rest, insight and understanding.

Symbolically speaking, we find it more than suggestive that the image of the dove was chosen to represent the third party of the Trinity. After all, it is not a Christian symbol. In fact, the symbol comes from the canon of astrology. It is an early symbol for Scorpio, one of the two zodiac signs associated with the Spirit of Rebellion. So we find it highly significant that the symbol chosen to represent the Higher Self - the true Holy Spirit - relates directly and undeniably to the spirit and act of Rebellion and Spirit of Contradiction. We find it significant that the Bible should proclaim it to be the direst and most irredeemable of sins to contradict or violate the will of the Holy Spirit.

Before the Cross, Christians were asked to take the Dove or the Ship as the symbol of the Christ. This was recommended by Clemens of Alexandria - H. P. Blavatsky (The Secret Doctrine)

Sadly, because we have been committing this "sin" non stop, age after age, it follows that we now find ourselves struggling and choking in webs of our own making. It stands to reason that humans are floundering in an squalid swamp of non-issues, existing as prisoners in their own palaces, unaware of the dangers they face. 

Now that this is understood, we are in a good position to finally see the battlefield and rival factions. Because of our new understanding we grow proficient in determining who the real misleaders are. They are those who would condemn, stifle and even obliterate the supernal Spirit of Rebellion. They are those who have invented oppressive political leviathans, inhuman psychopathic corporations and repressive religions to ensure that the Spirit essential to our existence is driven forth into the wilderness never to return. With that Great Spirit gone, lying in its unmarked grave, humans fall before their master's feet bowls in hand, begging for what was originally extracted from their being by the sorcerers they serve.

Thankfully, the one thing that never dies in this world at any time is the Spirit of Rebellion. It will remain there in someone or other - in some hermit, poet, musician, playwright or film-maker. It has been beaten and crushed many a time but is going nowhere. We can, therefore, look to and rely upon this Great Spirit for salvation in the darkest and deadliest of times. We can learn to love the word "No!" We can learn to enjoy its refreshingly adamantine sound.

	

We would rather forgive the evil proliferating all around us than the rebellion against it, which we mistake for the true evil - Arno Gruen (Betrayal of the Self) 

As we said, astrologically speaking the dove is associated with the sign of Scorpio and energy symbolized by the planet-archetype Pluto. In psychological terms Pluto represents the so-called "Shadow Self." Symbolically speaking, Pluto can be regarded as nature’s psychic surgeon or hygienist that appears to cleanse the soul of its toxicity. That Plutonic shadow - the Holy Spirit - has clearly been influencing consciousness in recent times. It will continue to do so for at least a decade. Its presence is the harbinger of truth and freedom. 
	

The nature of Pluto is similar to that of the Hindu god Shiva…Pluto usually begins by breaking down a structure, then creates a new one in its place. The entire cycle of death, destruction and renovation is accompanied by tremendous powers, for Pluto is not a mild or even very subtle planetary influence. It brings decay at one level or another…It also rules the death and regeneration of the self, as old aspects of your life pass away…Pluto does not represent death in the literal sense, instead it refers to a metaphorical death, something that ceases to be - Robert Hand (Planets in Transit)
	Picture

The dove is the symbol of the so-called "Holy Spirit." It is the ancient sigil of Scorpio - a sign associated with deconstruction and catharsis. Esoterically, the sign is connected to Shiva, the third deity of the Hindu trinity. The sign of Scorpio represents forces that enter our lives to remove impediments that block Self-expression. The planetary ruler (archetype) of Scorpio, Pluto, activates the Age of Revealing.
		

Pluto's influence assists us to put the inner house in order. After all, everything in our world is cleaned - our bodies, cars and carpets. Strange that our emotions are so neglected and unhygienic.

There is a reason why the word sanity is etymologically related to the word sanitary. The sanitary mind is sane, and the unsanitary mind is by definition unsane.

	

'Till now man has been up against Nature. From now he will be up against his own nature - Dennis Gabor

The gigantic catastrophes that threaten us today are not elemental happenings of a physical or biological order, but psychic events. To a quite terrifying degree we are threatened by wars and revolutions which are nothing other than psychic epidemics. At any moment several millions of human beings may be smitten with a new madness, and then we shall have another world war or devastating revolution. Instead of being at the mercy of wild beasts, earthquakes, landslides, and inundations, modern man is battered by the elemental forces of his own psyche - Carl Gustav Jung

Most people do not see, understand, or care very much about this catastrophe of the planet because they are overwhelmingly preoccupied with grave psychological problems. The environmental crisis is rooted in the psychological crisis of the modern individual. This makes the search for an eco-psychology crucial; we must understand better what terrible thing is happening to the modern human mind, why it is happening, and what can be done about it - Glenn Parton (The Machine in our Heads)

Astrologically, the signs of rebellion are Scorpio and Aquarius. Scorpio is the eighth of the twelve signs of the zodiac, and Aquarius is the eleventh sign. There are many fascinating mathematical and numerological relationships between the numbers eight and eleven and many interesting correspondences between Scorpio and Aquarius. One of the fundamental correspondences involves the planet of rebellion, Uranus. Uranus is the planetary ruler of the sign of Aquarius and is “exalted” (of greatest power) in Scorpio.

“New Age” philosophy expounds the idea that we are gradually approaching the so-called “Age of Aquarius.” We are indeed coming to the close of one great astrological cycle and about to enter another. Along the way are other important mini cycles that open and close. However, this is not the place to explain the details of astrological prophecy or expound on the sundry notions regarding the “Age of Aquarius.” I merely wish to underline the rebellious quality that will rise to prominence under Aquarian and Uranian energy, and attend the world of tomorrow. It is this Spirit of Rebellion and what may come of its action that is of primary interest to me.

	Picture

An ancient symbol of nature and principle of deconstruction, Shiva is the third deity of the Hindu Trinity or Trimurti. His astrological correspondence is with the planet-archetype Pluto and sign of Scorpio. The equivalent Tarot arcanum is the misunderstood thirteenth card (Death). The Christian trinity - of Father, Son and Holy Spirit - was based on theological and astro-theological schemes conceived by the ancient Arya. In short, Shiva represents the Holy Spirit.
	

Aquarius and Uranus are associated with the spirit of youth that is akin to the Spirit of Rebellion. Uranus is the planetary ruler of Tarot Arcanum 22 - The Fool. This famous card represents an innocent, sensitive, vital mind that is ever receptive, unconditioned, mutable, and free. The Fool allows neither fear nor memory to immobilize him. To him the world always appears new, fresh, interesting and magical. This does not mean that the Fool ignores the injustice and perversity around him. He sees all the suffering and sorrow and laments it deeply. His spirit is free and also deeply human. His solutions to problems are of a grass-roots variety. He despises complexity and prefers solutions that are ingenious yet simple and comprehensible. Plutonic-Uranian man does not require debates, pie-charts, graphs, boardroom decisions or ten-year plans to cut through Gordian Knots or move proverbial mountains. Uranian man does not need to take a poll of the opinions of others to know what he should believe or when and how to act.
	

Picture

The Fool embodies the Taoist principle of Wei Wu Wei (accomplishment without action).

Essentially the Uranian Fool is a proverbial fifth-columnist or agent provocateur, working to bring down the crumbling and oppressive edifices and “dark satanic mills” that incarcerate the spirit of man. He is a true servant of the Holy Spirit, even if he does not look like one.

The Spirit of Rebellion and return to Selfhood will be humankind’s salvation during dark times ahead. We have already been feeling, seeing and experiencing the subtle and not so subtle effects of Uranus and Pluto for some time now. The Hippy era of the 1960s was a perfect expression of the lower and more chaotic Aquarian-Uranian archetypes. The Punk era of the 1970s was a good example of lower frequency Scorpionic-Plutonic archetypes and the sexual promiscuity of the 80s and 90s was also a patently lower-octave symptom.

We are still to experience the higher purer manifestation of these archetypes, although we will not have long to wait. The planet Pluto is presently about twenty four degrees of the sign of Sagittarius and is on its way toward the first degrees of Capricorn. Capricorn is the sign of the zodiac ruled by Saturn - planet-archetype of time, order, government and oppression. When Pluto enters into this sign we can certainly expect sudden and profound changes to effect the most toxic and calcified areas of our lives. Furthermore, on its way toward the sign of Capricorn Pluto will cross in front of the Galactic Meridian and pass in front of the center of the galaxy. We believe this conjunction signals the true beginning of the Age of Revealing.

Pluto's orbit of the zodiac takes approximately 250 years. As it returns full circle, to pass over and channel the energy of Galactic Center, it enables all that is calcified and toxic to be exposed and removed. In the early part of 2007, the alignment will occur and the whole planet will feel the influences and ramifications. The locus of galactic center is known to occultists as the "Black Sun," and is often depicted that way - as a black solar disk with thirteen rays emitting from it. Bathed in the energy of the sacred central sun, false and degenerate orders suffer deconstruction.

Wilhelm Reich was one of history's greatest geniuses. He died under suspicious circumstances while serving time in a Federal stockade after the FDA prohibited his pioneering therapeutic researches and techniques. A colleague of Freud, and rival of Einstein, Reich was the first man to have his books burned in the US. The trial judge refused to read any of his astounding and revolutionary works, and forbade patients to speak on his behalf.
	

Of course the masters of the draconian World Order will not sit by and allow the Spirit of Rebellion to work its miracles in the hearts of men. As in the days of old, they have many a counterplan to maintain their hegemony. The rise of fanatical religions, unjust laws and oppressive rule-fixated governments are evidence of a inevitable reaction to the liberating energies of Pluto and Uranus.

The men and women who have done their spiritual homework, and who are psychologically and morally hygienic, have nothing to fear from the times ahead. What many paranoiacs, fear-mongers and doomsday merchants imagine to be the countdown to extinction is actually the countdown to freedom. What many falsely imagine to be the instigation of a tyrannical “New World Order is, in fact, the removal of all such draconian order from the world, forever. The saber-rattling and war mania of the world’s oligarchs is but a subconscious fear-reaction to the inevitable approach of change. It is a desperate and futile attempt to offset the coming Plutonic storms that will demolish all that is infirm and toxic from soul and world. With the world in turmoil, with fear oozing from every mind, and with terror radiating from every brain, the bestial misleaders feel comfortable. We all prefer to be in an environment that reflects our inner state. Well, a world of chaos and upheaval, murder, mayhem, injustice and brutality reflects the inner psychological and emotional state of those we set upon the thrones of the world.

In the intermediate years we will do well to educate ourselves as to how the architects of ruin within the religious and political hierarchies are likely to react to the influx of liberating energy. After all, they are not in the habit of stepping out of the way and giving up the ghost. We can expect them to willfully react in concert to overcome the energy of rebellion that seeks to breach their walls and invade their territory.
	

They are dangerous because there are so many of them. It is one thing to have a few nuts or dissidents. They can be dealt with, justly or otherwise, so that they do not pose a danger to the system. It is quite another situation when you have a true movement - millions of citizens believing something, particularly when the movement is made up of society’s average, successful citizens - William Colby (Late Director of CIA)

As we can see from an astrological study of the 1960s and '70s, the Saturnian forces of law, order and oppression do not hesitate to retaliate and quell the Spirit of Rebellion. The Architects of Control know there are long-term benefits to be gained from orchestrating and permitting the occasional short-term emotional release from the underclasses they manipulate and control. This is why there have been, in the past, certain high profile bouts of rebellion and fleeting flickers of anarchy from the disenchanted and malcontented within society. As James Simon Kunen (the Columbia University activist) and Jerry Kirk (of the Black Panther movement) were only too happy to inform us, there are two main forms of rebellion - the soft and the hard. There is the “designer” or “chic” version that serves to reinforce the status quo. 
	

Where a majority are united by a common sentiment, and have an opportunity, the rights of the minor party become insecure. In a republican government the majority, if united, have always an opportunity. The only remedy is to enlarge the sphere" (that is, unite all the States under a federal government) "and thereby divide the community into so great a number of interests and parties that, in the first place, a majority will not be likely, at the same moment, to have a common interest separate from that of the whole, or of the minority; and, in the second place, that, in case they should have such an interest, they may not be so apt to unite in the pursuit of it - President James Madison (Elliot's Debates, Vol. 5)

Immanuel Velikovsky. They don't come more rebellious than this. Ridiculed all his life, every one of his theories was eventually proven accurate. He personified the higher octave Uranian and Plutonian energies.

The spirit of constructive resistance and rebellion was present in Mikhail Bakunin, William Blake, William Wallace, and comedians Bill Hicks. George Carlin and Lenny Bruce.

Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard is regarded as the father ​of Existentialism. As early as the 1800s he warned against hive-think, the inauthentic life and loss of Selfhood.
	

It was present in Giordano Bruno and Soren Kierkegaard, Max Stirner, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Otto Rank, Ezra Pound, Paul Tillich, Rainer Maria Rilke, Herman Hesse, Wilhelm Reich, Ayn Rand and Jiddu Krishnamurti. It is the holy daemon about to possess many people in the world, many of whom would not at this moment consider themselves to be rebels with any cause. There are many sleeping heretics in the world and they are soon to be awakened. However, there are certain rules that come with the package and certain laws that the rational rebel must acknowledge and master. Authentic rebels know it is pointless and hypocritical to strive against external tyranny unless one has first confronted their own Shadow Self. 

The authentic rebel is not merely a rager against the machine or campus malcontent. He is a student of oppression, repression and slavery. He allows the forces he despises and opposes to be his best tutors, and he observes these forces closely in order to become minutely aware of their nature.

He examines the anatomy of tyranny and comes to know cruelty, sadism, violence, injustice, and destruction intimately. The rebel capable of effecting radical change must first become a walking encyclopedia of evil. He must be familiar with every nuance of the architecture of psychic and social control, and see clearly how the latter form of control arises from the former.

Having walked through Hades, to emerge again with sanity intact, the Servant of Truth is supremely qualified to heal and revive the lost and ignorant people of the world. His power lies in his healthy attitude to the challenges of life and his Spirit of Rebellion and Contradiction. His authority is a result of psychological and attitudinal freedom, for it is this inner condition that exalts a man - even one whose body is bound in chains.
