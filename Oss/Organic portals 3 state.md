Boris Mouravieff points out that there are 2 races. 
Pre-adamic man and adamic man

Pre-adamic is the manof the 6th day. Blessed by the creator and told to go out and be fruit full – lower centers of animistic in nature – (perhaps sentient like elephants)


Adamic man – created by jehovah to cultivate the fields – a slave race! 


My interpretations 
6th day man is referring to the original man from the planet part of gia has sentient is part of the planetary brotherhood dolphins, elephant, whales, orgautans. Reincarnates until he can reach 
Is truly divine in origin and has a connection to the pleroma has a concept of gnosis.  Seeks the truth and works to elevate their guiding spirit which in turn elevates the bodily reincarnation over time until they can leave the body and become a light being and go to that stage of conciousness evolution (what happens not sure but I can presume they become like gods and have to take a role in elevating the remaining conciness left behind) teaches to be humble and elevate them again to a the next level)

Adamic man Gen 2:5 talks of no persons to cultivate the land so Jehovah created adam. 
5neither wild plants nor grains were growing on the earth. For the Lord God had not yet sent rain to water the earth, and there were no people to cultivate the soil. 6Instead, springsb came up from the ground and watered all the land. 7Then the Lord God formed the man from the dust of the ground. He breathed the breath of life into the man’s nostrils, and the man became a living person. 

Jehovah is the demiurge ho thinks he could copy the creation but he breathed a soul into adam and adam went bad not beleiving JAH, thought he was a god. Maybe but had to go throught the process pre-adamic had gone through but Jah cocked up and missed a bit.
Down to Jah to destroy rebelious adam or but they still need a slave race. Kept a few and created a control matrix 

Problem is the pre0adamic man isn’t a servant but is caught in this control matrix 
The blue bloods are PRADM lets says and they pass this secret knowledge intergenerationally they tend to rise to the top and have become ruling elites.

Some and not born into the tight knit group don’t receive the leg up and struggle in life tryin to conform to the control matirx set up by Jah – there way out is by initiation into mystry schools like masons where the PRADM are ID’d and given leg up, through self knowledge study and esoteric work, becoming invincible as per chaos magic, intiated via sex magic – via heros journeys etc etc they might not get the full relisation in this life but will carry the self gained knowledge to the next and start from a higher level with more imunity to the control matrix

Adamic man has a soul and is capable of achieving the higher realms but there is much much more work for them to do. They first have to go through gia become the christ archetype. 
The matrix control system adapts to the baseline knowledge as more adamic become aware the control systems throws more at them they have to expell the same efforrt as always but adamics are starting in a system that has less religious dogma and persecution in some parts and if they still don’t take a step up they come back into the old style reliogous dogma ie. islam 


PRAD man didn’t fall he was traumatised by the planetary fall form the coccon of saturn the sky fell and they lost the amplifier connection to the pleroma that was Saturn. 

Adamic fell after they haughtyly assumed they were gods and tried to run before they could walk.


SO BORIS might have gotten is wrong a bit but he  first published in 1961 he didn’t have acces to the Apocryphon of John  which states almost the opposite
The First Man
[This is the one who appeared to them.
He appeared in the form of a human being.]
All of the realm of the chief ruler quaked!
The foundations of the abyss moved!
He illuminated the waters above the world of matter,
His image shown in those waters.
All the demons and the first ruler together gazed up
Toward the underside of the newly shining waters.
Through that light they saw the Image in the waters.
Yaldabaoth said to his subordinate demons:
“Let’s create a man according to the image of God
And our own likeness
So that his image will illuminate us.”  Adamic man is the slave race built by the demiurge
Each one through another’s Power created aspects of the man;
Each added a characteristic corresponding to the psychic factors
They had seen in the Image above them.
They made a creature of substance
In the likeness of that perfect First Man – (preadamic!!)
And they said, “Let us call him Adam, so that his name will give us the power of light.”
His mother’s divine Power left Yaldabaoth
It entered the psychic human body
Modeled on the primordial image.
The human body moved!
It grew powerful!
It shone!

Adamic does have a soul – but it corrupted and spills over the container- 
First man pre-adamic must is pneumatic
Kurt Rudolph writes (Gnosis, pp. 102-103):
In this document [Secret Book of John] too there is reference to the coming into being of three men: the psychic, the pneumatic and the earthly. Their binding together is once again portrayed in a very detailed but considered fashion. First of all we have the "psychic Adam", whom the demiurge Jaldabaoth with his "seven emissaries" (Genesis 1.26 is drawn upon here also) creates after the image, reflected in the water of chaos, of the "holy perfect Father, the first man in the form of a man". Thus the device of imitation is again made to serve the powers of darkness, but of necessity it must be imperfect and finally needs the help of the powers of light, who thereby are able to ensure the fulfilment of the secret purpose of the plan of salvation. Our text is a patricularly impressive example of the opposition of the two basic powers, since every move on the one side is matched by a countermove on the other, until in the course of the development a certain pendulum effect is established. Corresponding to the ancient idea of the part played by the planets in the formation of the psychic body of man, the seven powers contribute from their own elements the following "souls" for Adam: the "bone-soul", the "sinew-soul", the "flesh-soul", the "marrow-soul", the "blood-soul", the "skin-soul", and the "hair-soul". These "souls of the body" correspond, as is frequently the case in gnostic thought, to macrocosmic powers (providence, divinity, lordship, fire, kingdom, insight, wisdom). Behind this evidently lies the idea of the psychic capacities of man, belonging to the earthly intellectual (immaterial) sphere, in contrast to the supramundane intellectual element which is a gracious gift from the world above. In spit of the skill devoted to the formation of this psychic body it remains immobile and it is not possible to make him stand upright. This gives "Wisdom" (sophia) opportunity to intervene in order to win back the power which through her error she had lost to her son the Demiurge. She prays "the Father of the all" for help; he has recourse to deception (this is evidently quite permissible in dealing with the evil powers): "By a holy decree he sent the "self-originate" (autogenes) and the four lights in the form of the angels of the first archon. They gave him advice, that they might bring out from him the power of the mother. They said to him: "Breathe into his face (something) of the spirit (pneuma) which is in you, and the thing will raise itself up". "And (so) he breathed into him of his spirit—it is the power from the mother—into the body, and it moved at once . . . " In this way the pneumatic seed finds its way into the psychic Adam, and is thus no longer subject exclusively to the control of the powers of darkness.
