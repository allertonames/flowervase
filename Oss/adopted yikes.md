#### Chapter 1

I was born – or so I am led to believe in march 1971 – my mother was a young 17 year old unwed girl from a small town in Yorkshire and the cultural societal pressures in those days said it was better for baby to be taken away and given to a married couple who wanted a baby but could not have their own. So that's what happened to me. I have no idea how long I spent with my biological mother – I feel there was enough time to make a bond, the mother baby bond that nature sets up with biology and chemistry and emotions that bond that will last a life time, a bond that compels each to self sacrifice for the other. I feel that bond was made for long enough for it to truly devastate me when it was broken. To me it was absolutely life threatening the survival instinct kicks in its an automatic response built into life that sent part of my spirit, my soul, my self, my essence tumbling back down into the abyss where it had been nurtured for 9 months by the supreme archetypal mother goddess and push the remaining physical part forward to survive at all costs in any way possible in the cold harsh material, physical realm that was Yorkshire in the early 70’s. 

After an unknown amount of time in the place babies are kept before I was placed with the new parents I was the second adopted child 7-8 years into the marriage 2.5 years after the first adopted child, my brother. Now I look back and can see I was a token to keep a marriage together an item to replace the love that was dwindling and mostly lost between my new “mother” and “father”.  An object for my father to silently loath and a source of unconditional love for mother to extract and replace the hole in her soul. 

The trauma of breaking the true mother-baby dyad bond split my psyche, the true self was cocooned away into the archetypal world, the spirit realm, the Trans-personal space, the dream world, the place of the ancestors, of the gods, the invisible the etc etc  call it what you may – it is real,  my spirit lived their much longer than it was supposed to, it never felt safe for it to reincarnate back into the body it left in the first hours, days, weeks until after years of confusion and disassociation, years of supernatural events trying to remind me of something I’d lost, years of  soul searching, research and looking outside for what was missing inside but now as I write after a long journey and many long dark nights some 46 years later I feel I am closer than ever to regaining my true Self

My survival instincts created a false ego and a false self into the body of the baby that remained. It was this false self that was presented to the world, my new parents and the reflection I saw in the mirror my I, myself, me, but my second sight and the quiet voice from my true hidden self gave me the feeling, a knowing that it wasn’t true, not me. For most of my life I have been conditioned to dismiss that quiet voice, ignored what the second sight showed me, as I tried to fit the mold created by my “parents” for me. My survival false-self  quickly learned to adapt, to fit in, to please to make people like me, to take care of me or else I’d suffer the harsh words, criticism, shame and guilt that was layered on top of that first life threatening trauma society still ignores and diminishes. 

It was only in 1987 they started to give anesthetist to babies who had minor and major surgical operations prior to that in their “wisdom” and despite the babies cries of pain they said the baby will not remember it so why waste it or take the risk. Huge trauma is very rarely recalled, the memories are bottled up and hidden away beneath layers of screen memories, allegories and recurring nightmares. But the body remembers the muscles contract and recoil when it senses a similar situation. 





















In no way am I saying my adoptive parents deliberately put me through these ordeals, they both were-still are emotionally immature, unconscious to their parenting skills and in all likelihood not  aware of their own inner self-hood.  Also in no way do my experiences stack up against the trauma, beatings, sexual abuse some kids have suffered, but this is my story I feel writing it down is part of my own healing process. 

This focus was brought to light after an encounter with a narcisistic uncaring paretn in a airbnb I stayed in (more on that later)

AS with most children memories of early childhood and few and far between but what I find unsettleing I have big chunks of memeries missing all the way up to adulthood. I don’t recall many birthdays, teachers names, school friends, happy days out, quality time with mum or dad, theres some but not much and then the memories that seems to stick out as penetrating into the split psyche of my true self as something of note because it was either painful, full of high wierdness or a  big flag to what the bible has called the powers and principalities that control the world behind the scences – the hidden hand, the Archons – (more and that later). 

First school – Grove house 
The first 2 years 5-7 had a seperate teaching area and playground all the kids coming together for assemblies. I recollect visiting the school with my mum I guess in the spring time before I would start with everone else in september. I recollect that I was so exicited at seeing a wild west type fort with figures to play with on the floor of the main classroom I didn’t or could have one but then I was bitterly disapointed on arrival on my first day to see it packed away and told it’s only brought out for sepcial occasions – I don’t recolect any special occasions that it was brought out to play with. 

In those days we all got a free school milk the milk Thatcher stoped in the 80’s – there was a system to rotate who would be milk monitor and get to do what ever extra thing it was the milk monitor did it consisted of names written on cards in a wall folder the name at the front of the pile was that days child and it was then placed at the back gradually moving forward until 25 days or so later it was back at the front. I decided I liked being the milk guy – I guess I felt special, wanted, liked. So I would move my name card forward once it was moved to the back – I moved to far forward and to often and was subsequently caught in the act. 

Aprt from that there was a series events I label as high weirdness or the archon type that I’d forgotten about (bottled up) until after the PTSD event in 2006 (more later) 

Imagine all the 6-7 year olds around 60 are gathered together for a special talk, the teachers were explaining about the Prime minister that he lived at number 10 downing street, then asked a question – Who lives at number 11 – firstly it’s a very strange question for that age group even 16-18 unless they were specifically learningi about it. I pondered put my hand up and it wsa probably the first time I had the expectant look, with breaths held waiting almost pulling the words out of my mouth. I said the prime minstered wife – and the teachers took a sigh of relief or thats how it felt, a few laughs and no it was the chancellor of the excheqor – of course kids of that age know this type of stuff. For note the Prime minster was James Callahan and the Exchequr was Bildeburg founding member Dennis Healey. Later in life I got the intuition that there was more to this. 

At around the same time there was an assembly for all children – we were told that some one had taken the flowers growing around the school, this was bad, and no-one should do it. I had no previous want or desire to do such a thing, the idea and the will to do it, was now put into me that very evening I visited the small playground where the flowers were growing picked a bunch of them and was caught in the act by the caretaker. He took me to his onsite house where I waited and watched his wife was crying far to many tears for the occasion almost as if someone had died (or was about to) – She asked why I did it – I don’t know – who were the flowers for – I don’t know – were they for your mum – Errr yes that answer will do as she seemed pleased if they were. This could be a first memory of when I used my empathic sixth sense to read the situation and make wahtever adjustment need to placate whomever was infront of me. When I remebered these events later in life and reflected on them,  at first I saw this as a means to identify a poison container, and black sheep and object for the social psycholical abuse. After more reading on Jung the individuation process, Self and after the events of 2017 I saw it as a means to ID soulless child or a child with out a Self Self and soul and portals wll be discussed later) (my parents didn’t have a strong sense of internal Self at the time so how could they inculcate one in me? ) it could be both a person without their own self (self-posssed(or parents protection) becomes the poison container for xxx to do yyyy and zzzz.  I might have to detor onto how a child of trauma is able to disassociate and split or into fantasy.  I was able to disassociate and hence not recollect the events (like being abused in No. 11 downing street for example) 
A similar thing happened at the start of middle school – and assembly about bulling  kids for money – It’s bad – don’t do it -  oh that’s and idea and I go out and do it, get found out, taken to headmaster but I cannot account for why I freeze in the face of shame and guilt. 
Even after the 2006 (where I’m sure I was traumatised back to the same pscyholical split in thse early years) I read in the daily mail about the new designer drugs and after years of being clean and the wonderful reports of how effective they were I had the idea and the will to so them put into me. 

My recurring nightmare
It was set in the grounds of Hodgson fold – the old farm building that were in ruins at the time, it was a bit of up on the hill was Hanon upper school and inbetwen were raised bank leading to soccor pitches then another steeper longer bank to the next set of pitches. In the old farm buildings soliders were dug in firing upon the enemy up on the soccor pitches a giant gorilla like king kong the artilery rounds would hit him but have little effect occasionaly his face would be set alight the flames burning he wuld wipe his hand over his face that would take away a layer of flaming skin and make his head shrink a little – this would repeat and repeat until his head shrunk to a tiny match head and then it would pop back up to full size. I never saw the 2 sides come together or defeat one another just the eternal struggle of one side over the other. Again after my 2006 PTSD event I had that dream again a couple of times - 
Jung analysis – tells me it’s the slit in the psyche one eternal struggle to unite each seeing the other as the enemy – and the repetition while older again supports the regression of meantal state back to the very early very extreme split.

And


























The major catalyst that shone a light on my very early childhood as the source of my ongoing problms came in the form of an american who ran a airbnb in Da nang Vietnam.  It was one of those fortuas meetings that had the hallmarks of the universe coming to together to provide a synchronictous event but unike the brilliant bargain car I got, just when I needed one a few years prior to the traveling this synchronicty was a painful learning experience. 

I would normally find a plac I could hide away in my social ettiquette was fairly bad and I disliked my self even more after each self sabotaging socially akward encounter. I knew I came across as clingy, know it all, loud mouth and somehow had the knack of saying inpolite unkind things that I just wasn’t conscious of as being such until hours or days later. Searching for a remdy was one of th tings I had commited to through some sigil magic I begun dabbling in a few months earlier. 

Dane’s place the complete opposite it was a private room with private bathroom but int the shared house with him and his wife and a 2 year old daughter and a cat and dog to boot. Nice big room at a discounted price in the suburbs I took as a blessing and a oppotuntiy to interact on a family level that I had avoided for decades. 

It was Danes manner his way of talking, his attitude and his interaction with his child (I can’t call it parenting, at one point I heard him saying to his little 2 yars girl “you got a problem? – I’ll give you a problem” & why do you have to sing songs all day why you talk like baby? “ in the same tone you would hear between 2 arseholes facing off and pushing one another right before a fight broke out.)

There was a air of everything is too much trouble – you get what your given and resentment in the way he talked – it must be the way my parents talked to me as it tiggered something, a deep regression, a way of reacting and coping that I had developed in childhood. First it was behave in such a way to avoid being spoken to, then it was the physical stresses such as the eye lid twitching I hadn’t had since I was between 7-10 years old. I put it down to lack of sleep with the wifi router next to my bed, then it was the hypervigilencein my muscles allwys on red alert tense, lack of sleep as I continually scanned for the subtle noisese and subtxt that indicated I would son be on the end of a string of harsh words, shaming, guilt trip. Just over hearing Danes voice as he spoke in those critical ways to both his wife and child cut right through me and also paralysed me into silent obdiance. 

His shouting matches with his wife was like lisenign to school children, it pains me to write about them but heres and example. 
Him to his wife – you people are soooo stupid, why can’t you just do simple things like, you never learn, your soooo lazzy not clean up  - all in a really patronising loud bulling voice. 
Him to his child – in the same tone of voice – what you doing outside without your shoes on, dirty dirty – get back inside – stop sigining that song – 

All this was going on over the weeks I stayed there but the other curious thing was after the first couple of days where I obviously demonstrated my unconscious codependancy attachments to this father figure. A Canadian turned up and was stating the the other spare room. He was 65 a desperate alcoholic and lonely – he sort of attached to just as son as I gave him a polite and friendly greeting – it was more of a controller than a friend.  - more about my those type of people later. 

All this toghether causes me great stress and sleepless nights  and even my body shape started to change back towards the gait of somone literally carring a heavy weight on teir shoulders
– I was hoping glen would go after a week but he kept stay on so I decided to leave after – I felt I couldn’t talk to dane and say I was going as it would raise questions and in my state of obdience I would probably sgre to stay on and 

I found another place and movd out –

I found anojther palce and it was like a weight lifted off my shoulders – I had huge physicaligacl affects – my hypervigilence felt like it was listenign to the thoughts of the people in the house. I didn’t feel fully in control of my body – I had a huge urge to leave my room but It felt it was at the silent behest of glen so I would bump into him in the corridor which would lead to me offering to go with him for dinner or a day out or the like even though I didn’t want to – my inner bounderies were not my own. My muscles were tense and I could feel them wanting to follow this interal dialougue to bump into glenn. I’d had similar before but this was the most intense I’d had – maybe I had built a little independence and selfhood I was able to resist – like being called by the sirens to the rocks I was feeling compelled 

So much for a great place to stay but it taught me a huge lesson – maybe the most important one I’d had in a long time. 

After I moved out I had to find out what the fuck happened and another synchonicity came my way – not sure how or why I came across videos recommendations in ym youtube feed pointing to SLDD – self love deficencies disorder. It listed th symptoms of co dependancy all of which I had – and pointed to narcassistic parents as the cause. 
I could see the narc in Danes but still denied it in my own upbringing – it took a few days of reflection and remembering to spot those subtle underlying narc traits form both sides


It wasn’t long before I was feeling the physical affects, firstly within days my i lid was twitching involuntarily 


I left the UK a couple of years ago on what I called a hero journey – 


rewrite this to be in the 3rd person. make it grammatically correctly follow a typical biography arc

Born in March 1971, the individual faced a tumultuous start to life. Their mother, a young unwed girl from Yorkshire, succumbed to societal pressures and placed the baby for adoption shortly after birth. This early separation led to profound emotional ramifications, as the bond between mother and child was abruptly severed, leaving a lasting impact on the child's psyche.

After an indeterminate period in a care facility, the child was adopted into a family that had already welcomed another adopted child. The narrative suggests that the adoptee was seen as a means to mend the fraying relationship between their adoptive parents, rather than as an individual. This perception fostered feelings of inadequacy and rejection, leading to a complex emotional landscape characterized by the struggle for identity.

Throughout their childhood, memories remained sparse and fragmented. Significant events were often overshadowed by feelings of alienation and confusion. The adoptee grappled with a false sense of self, shaped by the need to conform to their adoptive parents' expectations while suppressing their true identity. This dissonance manifested in various ways, including anxiety and disassociation.

The narrative also touches upon broader themes of trauma associated with adoption. Research indicates that adopted children often face identity crises and emotional challenges stemming from their unique experiences. Feelings of grief and loss are common, as they navigate the complexities of their dual identities—one shaped by biological roots and another by adoptive circumstances[1][3][5].

As adulthood approached, encounters with figures reminiscent of their past triggered deeper reflections on their upbringing. A significant moment occurred during a stay at an Airbnb in Vietnam, where interactions with a host brought unresolved childhood traumas to the forefront. The host's behavior mirrored patterns from the adoptee's early life, prompting a reevaluation of long-held beliefs about themselves and their relationships.

In summary, this individual's journey reflects the intricate interplay between adoption, identity formation, and trauma recovery. Their story is not just one of survival but also of ongoing healing and self-discovery as they strive to reclaim their true self amidst the shadows of their past.
