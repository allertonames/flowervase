Egyptian Origin


of the Tarot
.

by Michael Tsarion

When the quadrangle is made round, then is all the secret found - Alchemical Adage
The 22 cards of the Major Arcana are exquisite "snap shots" of the heavens. Specifically, they are composite hierograms encapsulating the 12 precessional ages, from Aries to Pisces.

The precessional cycle lasts for 25.920 years. It takes the sun 2,160 years to pass completely through a single sign, 72 years for one degree of arc.

Other zodiacal images were expertly incorporated into the cards. This is because there are 88 additional constellations in and around the ecliptic. The 12 we know are merely a convenient homogenization of the elaborate stellar mythos.

The 88 are known as extra-zodiacal constellations and also as paranatellons. They include Lyra (the harp), Cygnus (swan), Cetus (whale or sea-monster), Aquila (eagle), Corvus (raven) and hydra (serpent), etc. There are also the four cardinal stars - Aldebaran, Regulus, Antares and Fomahault. The symbols of these, and dozens more, have been secreted into the Major Arcana.

Zodical leitmotifs are found in plenty in the Old and New Testaments, in the Apocrypha, and many other sacred scriptures.

As to the cryptic connections between astrology and Tarot, it is suggestive that, when added digitally, the numbers 1 to 12 (the zodiac) equal 78, the number of cards in a complete Tarot deck.


MAGICIAN
Card number 1. The word one connotes on, which cryptically alludes to the sun and light. The great city of th sun and Solar Cult was situated on the Giza Plateau at the Nile Delta, not far from the Great Pyramid and Sphinx. The Greeks named the city Heliopolis. However, the ancient Egyptians knew the city as An or On - city of light and the gods of light. The word also connotes Yoni, the female principle. Yoni not only alludes to female genitalia, but also to the so-called vesica pisces - or fish shape - revered by architects and practitioners of sacred geometry. Clearly, the figure in this card represents an architect.

His table stands for the Great Pyramid, which has sides of three and base of four. The Magician's table likewise has a square top and three legs. His serpentine belt tells that he is a member of the ancient Stellar Cult. Their chief concern was the polar region or circumpolar region in the extreme north. (See my books Astro-Theology & Sidereal Mythology, and Trees of Life for more on this subject...)

The strange figure above his head - the lemniscate - represents this zodiac and all-important circumpolar zone, known to the ancient archimandrites as the Fields of Aaru. Later in history it appears as the so-called Garden of Eden (Idunn), the Garden of Hesperides, Paradise (which means a walled garden), Avalon, Arcadia. Arctic Homeland, Polaria, Arktos, Hyperborea, Ultima Thule, etc.

The Stellar Cult existed all over the world. Members used the serpent as an insignia. The great northern constellation of Draco was sacred to them. It represented the good heavenly serpent or ever watchful dragon, protector of the tree (pole). The protector of the garden was also rendered as a crocodile. Sobek can be seen in the great zodiac of Dendera, dedicated to Isis and Hathor. His constellation sits by that of the great hippo goddess Taurt, from whose name we get the word Tarot. Hence, there can be no doubt that the Tarot (the Major Arcana) originated in Egypt, from where it spread to other climes. Taurt's name can also be rendered Taweret or Tarut, Astarte, Ishtar, Ostara, Easter, Star, Tara, etc. The term Torah is a derivation of her name, meaning "way" and also "law." Taurt evolved into the words circle, Circe and also church. Taurt is, therefore, the original "Holy Mother Church." The word "truth" is also a derivation of her name. Isis is a later version of this primordial stellar figure.

The motif of the garden of God (Yahweh), as found in Genesis, derives from the heavenly garden. The serpent was recast as an evil entity. This process of disfigurement was the common practice of ancient mythmongers, who habitually appropriated and cannibalized stellar lore. The ransakcing went on for generations.

The figure seen is clearly a member of the Ibaru, or Stellar Cult. He is an initiator of the great mystery schools on the Nile. There were originally seven nomes or temple-cities on the Nile, each representing one of the original pole stars. At these sacerdotal sites the great esoteric doctrines were taught, and thence taken to the four corners of the world.

The Magician's four-square table with its three legs represents the Great Pyramid. It also connotes the numbers 7 and 12, alluding to the 7 known planets and 12 signs of the solar zodiac.

On his table we find symbols of the four elements - fire, water, air and earth. The four items also stand for the suits - Wands, Cups, Swords and Disks (or Pentacles). These in turn represent the four personality types - Intellect, Emotion, Intuition and Sensation. They can also be seen as connoting the four divination arts, which must be brought together, as it were, on the same table, these being Tarot, Astrology, Kabala and Numerology. (Here for more...)

The Magician points upward toward celestial wonders - to the stellar dome - and downward toward the terrestrial domain on which we stand as students of reality. Like the ancients, we too look to the heavens for instuction.

The card's esoteric letter is B or Beth (pronounced bayth), meaning "House of God." Again, the reference is to the Great Pyramid in Egypt.

HIGH PRIESTESS
This image represents one of Egypt's foremost goddesses - Isis. This goddess personified the Nile, font of all life. Isis and her sister Nephthys were later versions of the most ancient goddesses known as Wadjet and Nekhbet, rulers of the two lands.

Note the figure's dress. It is blue, connoting the so-called Blue Nile. The hem flows, water-like, over a crescent moon. The appearance of the moon in this phase marked the time in Egypt when the waters of the Nile began to rise, bringing life to the parched land. Lunar symbolism is also embodied in the figure's headgear. Horns were associated with wisdom and telestic rites.

The figure also corresponds with Nuith, goddess of the night sky.

The river goddess of the Nile is, esoterically, the goddess of the river in the sky, that is the Milky Way. This celestial river turns up later as the rivers Lethe, Avernus and Styx, etc.

The black and white pillars have several meanings. Primarily, they allude to the banks of the Nile. The banks were then styled by temple-builders as the pillars Jakin and Boaz, standing at the portals of the temple. This tradition was adopted by the Israelites. The pillars also represent two sacred trees. And like the black and white squares seen in Masonic halls, they indicate knowledge and ignorance.

The cubic throne upon which she sits stands for a salt crystal. Salt, yeast, grain and water were ancient goddess symbols. If a physical cube is opened into its planes, it makes a latin cross of 3 horizontal sections and 4 vertical sections.

The HIgh Priestess also bears a cross on her chest, signifying the number 10, indicating completion and perfection. Adding the numbers 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 in the Pythagorean manner, we get 10, the number of perfection. It is also the number encapsulating the four stages of consciousness (Here for more...)

Interestingly, the word Atum is numerologically 1, 2, 3, 4. Adam is 1, 4, 1, 4 - as with human hands, of one thumb and four fingers for each hand.

The scroll on her lap bears the word Torah, meaning "law." It does not, however, indicate the Jewish holy book. Rather it connotes the Tarot, over which she presides. The zodiac is the "girdle of Isis," and was likened to a great unfurled scoll. As said earlier, the word Tarot origintes with Taurt, the name of the supreme stellar matriach.

The tree behind her is that of the Kabala, sacred to the Ibaru. The halved pomegranates on it are associated with the "underworld," and goddesses of initation into the esoteric arts. The term Kabala or Cabala comes from the name of the goddess Cybele. She was the mother/consort of sun-god Mithra, as Isis was mother of Horus.

In Egypt Isis was known as Aset (or Auset). As the imagery suggests, she is the gateway to the mysteries, the authentic "Holy Mother Church."

Before Christian mythmongers got hold of it, the goddess herself was considered the "Tree of Life." In this case, she can hardly eat of herself or bring about the fall of man.

EMPRESS
Whereas the High Priestess symbolizes the moon and lunar qualities, the Empress represents the more accessible female. In Egyptian myth she corresponds with Hathor.

Astrologically, the card and figure are associated with Venus, one of the most important planets for ancient peoples. Although Venus had a dark side, the goddess was usually considered benefic. She is the archetypal mother, giver of life. 

Hathor, and similar goddesses, represented the fertile land and waters of the NIle. (Note the small stream flowing near the figure's throne.) The Empress represents growth, fertility, abundance, good luck, celebration and happiness.

The great temple of Dendera, featuring one of the earliest zodiacs, was dedicated to Isis and Hathor. One represnted the heavens, the other the earth. Hathor was certainly the antetype for Demeter, Ceres, Hera, Juno and Gaia. She is similar to Inanna and Aphrodite.

EMPEROR
Here we have the imperious god of the infertile red desert, the god Set. Brother of sun-god Horus, he was cast as an evil-doer and rival. In Egyptian iconography, Set represented the scorched lands on one side of the Nile, presided over by the Scorpion King. The mountains behind his throne suggest the sign of Aries, as well as Mars, god of war. Egypt was one of the first nations to have an elaborate concept of the opposition between good and evil.

The figure also represents the great king of Egypt, who bore the title pharaoh - from pharos-nous, meaning "enlightened mind."

HIEROPHANT
Here we have the personification ofOsiris, one of the supreme deities for ancient Egyptians. The card also suggests the class of pharaohs and priests who ruled over the people for centuries. The great temples were designed and constructed in their name and by their decree.

Osiris was killed by Set and his body divided into many parts. This account of a great king's dismemberment is also found in other cultures. Originally, it related to the fertility of the earth, and transit of the sun from the overworld into the dark underworld of winter.

Osiris was often depicted colored green. He was the original "Green Man." At other times he is colored black. This is because the original name of Egypt was Khem, meaning "black land" (black meaning fertile land).

The word alchemy denotes Egypt, land of the high sciences and arts. The syllable hiero means priest, high or sacred. It refers to the ancient archive of esoteric knowledge preserved by Egyptian priests. This gnosis included the secrets of the "heavens" - that is the polar zone, precessional cycle of 25,920 years, 88 paranatellons, and characteristics of individual celestial bodies. The priests had the job of transposing celestial gnosis to the terrestiral level, to the lives and acts of the "gods" and cultural heroes.

The card also alludes to other important figures in the Egyptian pantheon, such as Geb, Atum, Amen Ra and Ptah, etc.

His triple-barred staff hearkens to the Druids or western Arya, and their brotherhoods in Egypt, namely the Amenists. The Druids divided their order into three branches or sub-orders. There were the Druids, the Bards and the Ovates. The Vatican takes its name from the lower order of Druids. The word faith references the Vates or Ovates. The term Bard means "north" or "northener." The word vicar comes from Vice-Ari - that is one who stands in for the high Druid. The word oligarch comes from the gaelic word Ollamh, the title of the high Druid. The term aristocracy originally signified the Arya.

LOVERS (THE LOVER)
The image of the young man, found on European decks, represents Horus the Younger. However, the Rider-Waite imagery also has significance. It refers to a central Egyptian concept, that of the twins and sacred wedding or Hieros Gamos.

The combat myth and twin motif is universal. It appears in the Old Testament in the stories of Cain and Abel and later in the New Testament story of Jesus and John the Baptist, not to mention that of Miriam and Martha. The tale of God and the Devil is also little more than a twin myth. Egyptian creation myths commonly feature a primal pair - Shu and Tefnut, Osiris and Isis, Nun and Nunet, etc,

The card features figures who resemble Adam and Eve. The two trees of Genesis are seen. However, this is an Egyptian motif. The trees represented the two "poles" of the north and south. The red mountain stands for the Great Pyramid.

That the tree and serpent are situated on Eve's side is not accidental The very name Eve comes from Hawah, meaning "serpent." In Egypt the hieroglyph for woman was a serpent, dragon or snake.

The designer of the card wished to suggest that the angelic figure hearkens to the female Eve, not the male Adam. Perhaps he is endowing her with special knowledge. Indeed, in Egypt female cults and sects held enormous power. No king could ascend to the position of pharaoh without the approval of the Great Royal Wives, and it was imperative that he married one of their princesses or queens in order to merit the position of pharaoh.

The whole image sugggests the Biblical Garden of Eden. However, this famous motif has many antetypes, such as the circumpolar "garden," and Arctic Holemand, etc. The motif is understood by astrologers to symbolize the preessional Age of Gemini. Most cards in the Major Arcana encapsulate themes derived from the twelve ages in the great Platonic Year of 25,920 years. They are composedof uranographs well-known and revered by the ancient Magi.

In European packs we see the young man with crossed arms, as in the style of a pharaoh. In some renditions he stands at the pinnacle of a triangle, connoting the pyramid.

CHARIOT
Here we see a well-known image from Egypt, namely the pharaoh on his chariot. Many images show him riding to war or, alternatively, on a hunt. The latter motif is also universal, and can be found as far away as Ireland.

This is card number seven, the most important number in the esoteric tradition. It was the sigil of the Stellar Cult, from which all secret societies and cults descend. That the week was divided into seven days celebrates the supremacy of this cult.

The sphinxes drawing the chariot directly refer to the land of Egypt and the sacred mystery schools there. Originally, the initiate had to pass through seven such schools. Note the starry canopy over his head, and belt of zodiac signs.

After the killing of Osiris, his son Horus angrily set out on a journey to locate the dispersed pieces of his father's body. He sought out and killed his evil uncle Set in a great combat, losing an eye in the process.

The image of a chariot recallls the tales of Icarus and Phaeton. The Celts envisioned the revolving heavens as a great round table or revolving chair. Esoterically, the sign of Cancer is known as the "gate of birth." All incoming souls enter creation through the the zone of cancer and exit via the opposite sign of Capricorn, the "gate of death."

STRENGTH (LUST)
This card's imagery epitomizes the land of Egypt and its traditions. The woman and lion are clearly allusions to the great Sphinx which stands proud on the Giza Plateau near the pyramid. In ancient times, it is believed the Sphinx faced the constellation of Leo, the lion. Note the pyramidical shaped hill in the background, clearly signifying the pyramid.

The woman may signify the lion goddesses Tefnut or Sekhmet.

Some scholars believe the building of the pyramid and sphinx dates back to the Age of Leo, hence the imagery in this card.

Annually, the sun rises to its highest position in Leo, the royal sign.

It is most suggestive that the lemniscate was added to this card, as it was to Arcanum 1 - the Magician. Do the first 8 cards represent an "octave" of sorts?

HERMIT
In astronomical terms, the Hermit (and sign of Virgo) marks the termination of the overworld cycle, the conclusion of the sun's passage through the Northern Arch of six signs.

The figure of the Hermit represents the god in his senility - the Senex. In Egypt he is the aged Amen Ra and also Atum, from which we get Adam. Gods of this type symbolized a most important event for ancient stargazers, namely the fall of the sun into the winter months. This declination was transposed to the saga of the sun-king, who like a charioteeer must experience the character-building challenges of the so-called "underworld." Hence we have young solar-heroes, like Icarus, falling into death or darkness from a great height.

This is a motif found in all prominent civilizations. Death itself was personified as an important transit on the great soul-making journey. Christians picked it up and had their sun-king, Jesus, going below to "harrow hell."

In the past, the fading of the light was a cause for concern and contemplation. It was as if nature herself was experiencing a death.

Umpteen god-men followed suit, encountering ferocious hybrid creatures and witch-like females attempting to waylay them. The aged Ra was seduced by the power-hungry Isis, Samson was betrayed by Delilah, sent into the underworld blinded and impotent, John the Baptist was betrayed by Salome, and so it goes with Tiresius, King Arthur, Robin Hood, and other heroes. The goddess Persephone also enters the underowrld to wed Hades, god of the dead. In Nordic climes the goddess of the underworld is called Hel.

In the Thoth version we see the sun's light fracturing and the gruesome dog Cerberus guarding the way below. The period is known, esoterically, as the "dark night of the soul." The worldly distractions fade and one is brought face to face with their true selves.

In the Rider-Waite version, and other European packs, we see the frail senex with staff and heavy cloak. The latter suggests a skin which must be shed as one undergoes being born again. The esoteric letter normally associated with this card is the all-important Yod, representing Yahweh himself, another hoary deity revered by Jews and Christians.

Nursery rhymes such as Jack and Jill cryptically allude to the sun's ascent to the zenith and subsequent descent into darkness.

The card's number 9 also connotes completion, retreat, silence and hermitage. Nine also connotes the ancient Nun, goddess of the primeval waters. It is a pun on none or nothing, as in the German nine.

WHEEL OF FORTUNE
This Arcanum exemplifies the sun's position in and movement through the zodiac. Here it is at the point of fall. The solar-hero is about to enter the night or underworld. Will he make it through or will he be tempted or betrayed?

We see the Egyptian deity Anubis, so-called "Opener of the Ways," the prototype of Hermes and Mercury. He is the psychopomp who appears in dog form in the Fool card. He appears again in Arcanum 18.

We also see a serpent and the word Rota, which can also be rendered Tora and Taro. Here the emphasis is on a wheel. It stands for the eternal laws of necessity that all must experience. Prince or pauper, all must undergo the natural cycles and rites of passage.

Later cultures chose to personify the fates as female. We have the goddess Fortuna, ruling over one's rise or fall. In any case, the card represents the knowledge and importance of cycles, closely observed by the ancient Egyptians and related races. The sphinix seen in the card famously embodied the four stages of life, from youth to old age.

Under the reign of Akhenaton, the sun was renamed from Amen to Aton. Curiously, this is card number ten. Akhenation is considered the father of monotheism.

Note the four creatures at each corner, as seen in Arcanum 5. They appear again in Arcanum 21. They represent the chief demarcations of the zodiac, the two solstices and two equinoxes. We find this stellar motif reprised in stories of the solar-king on the "cross."

JUSTICE (ADJUSTMENT)
Here we have a depiction of one of Egypt's supreme goddesses - Ma'at. She was the goddess of harmony and balance. Presiding over moral and legal law, she was the keeper of the book of life.

Ma'at presided over the soul's final judgment. Her emblem - a feather- can be seen on the great scales of judgment in the Book of the Dead and other texts. If one's heart weighs heavier than the feather, it is cast down and devoured by Sobek, the crocodile god. One must have obeyed the 42 codes of Ma'at to go forth to the throne of Osiris.

On either side of Ma'at we see two stylized trees, similar to those seen in Arcanum II - the High Priestess.

The sword stands for the sign of Aries, while the scales signify Libra, to which this correponds. Aries and Libra are direct opposites in the zodiacal wheel.

Ma'at is the goddess of measurement, proportion, mathematics and geometry. She is the antetype of Demeter. Her agent Thoth keeps the book of life and enters one's deeds within it.

That this card depicts a female is not accidental. On his difficult underworld traversal, the solar-hero often encounters a mysterious female who presents him with various challenges. She may also kindly present him with gifts to sustain him along the way.

Note how the artist drew her left hand, which subtly points downward, indicating the next phase of the Fool's (sun's) journey.

HANGED MAN
Here we have an image which brilliantly personifies the trials and tribulations of the underworld sojourn. Note the solar rays emitting from behind the figure's head.

Although this striking image recounts Nordic lore, and the saga of Odin, it has its equivalents in Egypt. Simply put, it represents the sun during its underworld traversal. He finds himself in a weakened state.

Some decks show the figure with coins falling from his pockets. This refers to one's essential poverty at the point of death. The soul must enter the otherworld chaste and humble. (It was customary at the point of death to empty one's pockets of any money.)

In most renditions, the figure's face is seen smiling and without distress, indicating that the ordeal is not imposed upon him, but is undergone willingly.

The figure's arms are apparently tied behind his back, suggesting forces over which humans have no control. 

The card depicts a scene which Egyptians knew all too well, namely the death and dismemberment of Osiris. Indeed, the motif of a sacerdotal tree is found in the stories of Osiris, Odin, Jesus, Buddha and Krishna. Astrologically, it may represent the polar axis.

The number 12 signifies zodiacal cycles and rites of passage. In the crucifixion story there are 3 crosses, a cryptic allusion to the zodiac.

The card's esoteric letter Mem was/is the only letter in the Hebrew alphabet spoken with the lips closed. It was, therefore, the letter associated with Hermetic secrets and mysteries, which cannot and should not be openly shaerd with the world.

The card also connotes the mystical practices for which Egypt was famous. Some scholars hold that the ancient Egyptian sages practiced various forms of yoga.a

DEATH
Here we see a figure recognized universally. In the Thoth version we see the skeleton wearing the great crown of Upper and Lower Egypt, which doubles as a symbol for spiritual unification.

During the underworld sojourn one is purged of their emotional and psychological impurities. One sheds delusions and negative outlooks and renovates their self-image.

Death, in this context, symbolizes a crucial stage of the ongoing journey toward enlightenment. In alchemy it represents the time of mortificatio or purgation, that is trial by water.

In the Rider-Waite we see the setting sun, emphasizing that this card is about the descent of the sun into the cold depths of winter.

TEMPERANCE (ART)
The angel seen here is similar to that seen in Arcanum 6, and also resembles the woman in Arcanum 8. The coloring is almost identical.

In Egyptian iconography seated deitties represent the forces of nature and the earth. Standing figures represent human traits, and winged figures denote higher matters, as well as stellar phenomena. The angel may, therefore, represent some stellar principle, or even an individual star or constellation.

The card corresponds with the sign of Sagittarius, the zone where we find Galactic Center. It was an important celestial zone studied by the Stellar Cult.

Sagittarius also runs near to a most important constellation, that of Ophiuchus, the "Serpent-Bearer." Ophiuchus is known to occult astrologers as the thirteenth sign of the zodiac. Special trials and rites are associated with it. In esoteric lore the number 13 often indicates this area of the zodiac and the challenges associated with it.

Again, note the sun setting low behind the horizon.

Since the card is connected to the fire signs, it probably represents the alchemical rite known as calcination, or trial by fire. The previous two cards represent trial by water.

(Realizing that the name Temperance relates merely to mundane fortune-casting meanings, Aleister Crowley correctly renamed the card "Art," to highlight higher octave meanings.)

THE DEVIL
An important deity in ancient Egypt was Apophis. Also known as Apep or Pepi, she was the great seerpentine ruler of the underworld. We see her in Arcanum 12 (Thoth Deck).

Here the image is of the god Pan. However, the goat god was well-known in Egypt. He appears as lord of the city of Mendes, and was known as Khumn the potter god who fashions man on his wheel.

The card signifies the missing phallus of the great god Osiris. Isis was able to gather all the parts of her slain husband except his phalus. Conseuently she made a magic phallus from gold. This enabled her to mate with Osiris and birth his avenger Horus. She secretly raised her infant in the marshes and reeds of the Nile, a story later "borrowed" by Jews and Christians.

The sign of Capricorn is where the sun falls to its lowest point. The solar-king is in his weakest and most vulnerable condition. The card's imagery signifies the dangers he faces, and the severe challenges he must overcome. Astrologically, Capricorn is the gate of death, the zone of spiritual darkness. This region was likened to the crypt of the zodiac. It is often associated with time, karma, ignorance and gross morals.

The two humanoid figures remind us somewhat of those in Arcanum 6. Although chained they are not in bondage. The chains around their necks are loose enough to be manually removed at any time. They passively wait to be led, and accept whatever kind of fate is decided for them.

In this sense, the card indfcates the opposite type to the sincere adept, those with no interest in profound mysteries and no higher aspirations. It marks the default setting for the masses. It is the starting point from which all future progress, should it occur, is measured and assessed.

The Egyptians accepted that there is a dark side to the nature of most gods and goddesses. They too act selfishly and thoughlessly. Although the ancient Egyptians were not atheists, they knew not to wholly trust the gods. An entry in an ancient papyrus scourges the gods. The dead soul has his own questions and remonstrations
against the conduct of the gods. They too must be held to account.

Note the inverted torch representing the descent of the sun. The implication is that there are powers greater than the light. How is one to discover the truth of the matter?

TOWER
Ancient races such as the Egyptians and Babylonians, etc, knew that the world had been shaken by cataclysm. They knew of the devastating comet and of "pole shift," as it is known.

The mysteries of sexuality are also encapsulated in this strange Arcanum. Ancients were fascinated by the mystery of birth. How does a soul enter creation, and why? Why do women give birth, not men? Why is life so short, and why are there infinite things to know in such a short time?

The image recalls the story of the Tower of Babylon and loss of the proto-langauage. It may also allude to the splitting of the sexes and loss of androgyny. It connotes scission, division and the need for reconstruction on all levels.

There can be little doubt that the striking imagery recalls catastrophic events which fragmented the kind of consciousness once experienced by our ancestors. Of course, the idea of a great fall was appropriated and rescripted by later civilizations.

In the esoteric tradition, the fall of Satan is described as occuring like a lightning flash.

On a mundane level the card represents forces over which one has no control.

THE STAR
One of the most important annual events in ancient Egypt was the rising of the star Sirius. This card commemorates the period when this great star appeared in the morning sky. It did so at the moment when the waters of the Nile began to rise and flood. This brought life back to the parched land. These critical events occured around July 25.

This card is associated with the sign of Aquarius, later symbolized by a man carrryig a water-pitcher. Here we see the goddess of the Nile holding two urns. She (the river) empties her waters on the land.

The stars of Aquarius were seen in the morning during the period when the Nile flooded - the period known as the Inundation. Hence the nursery rhyme of Jack and Jill and legend of the Holy Grail. In the latter caselm the sacred cup is in the keeping of three maidens It is due to this heavenly event that Christians adopted the rite of baptism, which was not practiced by the Jews.

It appeared to the Egyptians that there was, indeed, an intimate connection between celestial and terrestrial happenings. As the sign of the urns appeared in the sky, the Nile on earth rose. As above, so below.

In the stellar mythos, the figure is Taurt, goddess of the Great Bear constellation and garden in the sky.

THE MOON
This misnamed card has little to do with the moon. Rather, it should be associated with the planet Neptune. Its lunar features have to do with the goddess Isis during her period of lamentation. It is a motif adopted by Christians whose rehash is known as the pieta.

Here we see Isis weeping for the loss of her husband Osiris. Her tears fall to become the river Nile.

The card represents the final stages of the underworld journey and period just prior to the hero's rebirth.

In the Thoth version we again see Anubis the dog-headed guardian and opener of the ways. He dutifully watched over the sun-king throughout his dark journey through the six lower signs.

In the Rider-Waite, we see two canine animals, one a domesticated dog and the other a wild wolf. For thousands of years dogs were associated with madness and derangement of mind. This was especially with wild dogs, coyotes and wolves. They represent the wildness of nature and of primitive or lower states of consciousness. Any and all evolution, so-called, must be measured and assessed from a control or default state of being. This is probably why a dog is seen in the Fool card. Humans are what they are because of their ability to control their animal instincts. No animal is wholly aware of a thing called "world," nor can they ever choose or will to be other than they are. They cannot contemplate the meaning of their existence. The image of a dog in a card underlines the divide between human and animal, and emphasizes the unique metaphysical status of human beings.

We also see a stream representing the river of death, reprised later as the rivers Styx and Avernus. In the stellar mythos the river is the Milky way, along which the sun-god (Ra or Horus) passes on his heavenly boat. He slays the god of the underworld and triumphantly rises anew.

The card is associated with the sign of Pisces, the last sign of the twelve. It was known to ancient astrologers as the great sea or abyss.

THE SUN
The sun rises victorious to cast its light abroad. Springtime comes again, and darkness is overcome.

So too does the solar-hero arise after slaying the devils of darkness. He has completed the treacherous rites of passage and earned his illustrious reputation as lord of all.

The motif was later adopted by Jews and Chrisitans. In the latter case, we find Jesus walking on the waters and rising again after his humiliation and apparent death. The Church adopted the rite of baptism, and popes employed Piscean symbolism such as the miter and ring of the "fisherman," etc.

The zodiac sign of the sun's return is that of Aries. This word connotes arise. April comes from the Latin aperio, meaning "to open." Aries does indeed open the solar year.

For Christian mythmongers, this is the period of Christ's resurrection. For the Egyptians the sun-god was Amen Ra and briefly Aton. Jewish rabbis blew a ram's horn when the sun arose in the east.

JUDGEMENT (AEON)
Here we see another image celebrating resurrection. Light is born again to banish the forces of mental and physical darkness.

The card also emphasizes the importance of natural cycles and processes, which must be obeyed and honored even by the solar-hero. Evil is the subversion of the ordinances of the Moral Universe.

Again, as in Arcanum 6, it appears that the female figure is in direct connection with the angelic messenger. The three resurrected figures make the letters for Lux, or light.

The angel's bugle recalls the ram's horn used by rabbis to signal the rising of the sun on the eastern horizon.

Mountains are to be seen in several Arcana. They denote the Arctic Homeland, ancestral habitation of the Arya.

WORLD (UNIVERSE)
Here we have the card symbolizing total completion. The supreme goddess Taurt dances her cosmic dance. She represents the laws of necessity that all must obey, follow and revere.

She embodies the great quaternity and rite of circumnabulation.

In later times, she becomes Gaia, Demeter, Hera, Juno, as well as Aphrodite and Venus. She is the primordial Asherah, Astarte and Inanna.

The four animals allude to the cardinal points of the zodiac and calendar, as well as the stations during the hero's ritual circumnambulation. They also represent the unification of the four psychic hemispheres. As we see in the first card, the adept must nucleate the four elements.

The Christians adopted the fourfold imagery in their four evangelists and four gospels. The crucifix also serves as a leitmotif for the alchemical quaternity. It significes the geometrist's principle known as the "squaring of the circle."

As the saying goes: when you have made the quadrangle round, then is all the secret found.

THE FOOL
The card is also known as La Matto, or "crazy one." His path, the zodiac, was styled as a labyrinthine road full of twists and turns. One has to be mad to set out on it, or one will be driven mad at some point on it.

The sigils associated with this Arcanum - 0 and 22 - suggest circumnambulation and completion.

In Egyptian lore, this is the card of the adept who dare comprehend the mysteries of existence. He starts as a normal episodic without a clue. He has his head in the clouds, and thinks of life as one big adventure.

The eagle emblem on his bag suggests Ahom, the first letter of the Egyptian alphabet, the Alpha of the Greeks and Aleph of the Hebrews, from which we get our word "alive."

In his cap is the feather of Ma'at, who presides over the soul's final judgment.

Each following card encapsulates some characteristic or challenge to be realized or overcome by the Fool.

The term Fool is a corruption of Soleil or Sol, meaning "sun." We see the solar disk in the corner of the card. It also serves as a pun on solo and solitary, meaning "one alone." Some hold that this is because at one time there was a "second sun" in the sky. Interestingly, the term luna also connotes loneliness or aloneness.

The card's number 22 denotes the formula 22 over 7, or a complete circle. In this sense the figure embodies the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end.

The irony is that on a circle there is no beginning or end, only the illusion of movement and progress. One is always as near to or far from their destination as they can get. Better said, one's destination is always where they already are.
