'After crossing the call to adventure and the first threshold, the belly of the whale represents the final separation from the old world and old self. It's a time to clear and cleanse imposed ego programming to strip back any conditioning or entrainments’
By entering this stage the person shows their willingness to undergo a significant change that the coming stages will present.


Living in Thailand was crossing the first threshold where I made significant adjustments but I recognise I also carried over many of the patterns and habits from the UK not necessarily bad habits but they could be better. Travelling onto Cambodia definitely felt like entering the big bad belly of the whale, a testing ground for the old self.

My original plan was to go to Sihanoukville to have a knee's up - a bit of a party, it's the Pattaya of Cambodia apparently. Well it has a dirty beach, beer bar area, a bit of a sleazy atmosphere, Karaoke bars, but that's about it. It does have a laissez faire attitude to smoking weed, most bars are tolerant, some almost encourage it, and if you order your pizza "happy" in the right restaurant you're in for a night of the giggles.

The pharmacies will dish out just about anything and if you find the right places they will dish out the stuff they shouldn't. Access to many other vices are available but you have to really want them and seek them out, the place has a well deserved reputation for being like a wild west frontier town.

This loose travel plan was hatched all the way back in the UK, while I still had most of the old patterns and hooks in me, not many but enough. Those hooks are subtle they sit there light as a feather but deep in the back of you mind. Sitting waiting for whatever is the trigger that will catch that hook and start to reel you in.

We've all got them and some are practically impossible to evade like sugar, wheat, cheese, coffee, cake! All of them addictive, probably designed that way to get people hooked at a young age, then there's the grown up ones, sex, alcohol, nicotine, prescriptions meds- all legal so far, then we move onto more nefarious things like recreational drugs.

The door to officially sanctioned addiction  is built at an early age, sugar treats used as rewards or to shut up a noisy child will do it. Additiction doesn't have a proper door it's more like a swing door with a kick plate, no latch, no lock, damn easy to open. But at the back of the first addiction room if you look carefully and use your hands to search for the outline you'll find more doors with tamper evident paper seals. First one breaks then another and another but not that one, the one to the hard stuff, not until you've peaked through the window to glimpse probable fates, it's like a movie trailer where they only show you what will entice you in, you weigh up whatever trauma that pokes you in that direction with the soothing oblivion of couldn't care less.


Well, my doors had been prized opened years ago and like a whack-a-mole game as I shut one, another would open, after some years I got them shut all shut even the legal stuff but that just left the that legal swing door flapping and even easier to open if a trigger would pull on that hook and the cycle would start again. Each cycle was a  wheel that got smaller in size, time and weight but the wheel had to turn a full circle before it could be put away.  Before I left the UK I probably had only a couple of small wheels in the air but they were the hardest - booze, food, sugar,  oh and ganga but that's medicinal.

Even after years of clean living an old trigger would appear and I could feel that hook twitch and tug and I'd reminisce on those fleeting feel good moments of absolving care and responsibility but forget about the old "black dog of the night" that came afterwards where obliteration was the aim, in times gone by even the smallest trigger would be enough to get me flinging the doors wide open again and start another cycle.

It was on the bus to Sihanoukville I got hopefully the final obliteration vision. Maybe it had been waiting, knowing that I had planned to enter the vipers pit once more, a few triggers and easy access to all and sundry would surely lead to a big bad new wheel for me to turn around.

Don't get me wrong I got it, the trigger, the twitchy hook the reminisce of obliteration, even pictures in my minds eye, but I met it with incredulity, I don't want this, why is it even coming to mind after all this time? Maybe it was the final death throws as the hook tugged and tugged but slipped and pulled free.
"The idea that the passage of the magical threshold is a transit into a sphere of rebirth is symbolized in the worldwide womb image of the belly of the whale. The hero, instead of conquering or conciliating the power of the threshold, is swallowed into the unknown and would appear to have died" -- (Campbell 90)
The Road of Trials
The Sihanoukville whale ate me, chewed me up and spat me out, this was just the start of my road of many trials.
The road of trials is a series of tests, tasks or ordeals that the person must undergo to begin the transformation, Often the person fails one of more of these tests which often comes in 3’s

I'm starting off positive and claiming success in losing the hook of oblivion as a successful trial what are the other trials did I pass of fail? I'm on the road at least.


"This popular motif gives emphasis to the lesson that the passage of the threshold is a form of self-annihilation. . .[I]nstead of passing outward, beyond the confines of the visible world, the hero goes inward, to be born again. The disappearance corresponds to the passing of a worshipper into a temple - where he is to be quickened by the recollection of who and what he is, namely dust and ashes unless immortal. The temple interior, the belly of the whale, and the heavenly land beyond, above, and below the confines of the world, are one and the same. That is why the approaches and entrances to temples are flanked and defended by colossal gargoyles: dragons, lions, devil-slayers with drawn swords, resentful dwarfs, winged bulls. These are the threshold guardians to ward away all incapable of encountering the higher silences within. . .The devotee at the moment of entry into a temple undergoes a metamorphosis. His secular character remains without; he sheds it, as a snake its slough. Once inside he may be said to have died to time and returned to the World Womb, the World Navel, the Earthly Paradise. . .Allegorically, then, the passage into a temple and the hero-dive through the jaws of the whale are identical adventures, both demoting in picture language, the life-centering, life renewing act" -- (Campbell 91-92)

I know I've got issues, many many issues, socialising is one, previously it I didn't get much pleasure out of it. Ever heard of energy vampires? The type of people who drain you in a friendly way, I seem to encounter more than my fair share and now avoid these vampiric elements like the plague. I'm not anti-social just intolerant of bullshit, drama, and banal chitter chatter.


The apartment block I stayed in had a long walkway that doubled up as the balcony for all apartments, mine was at the end so there was no dodging anyone sat out front. My preference was to dodge them, it's the best way to avoid the energy vampires. But after all the calming time in Thailand it wasn't so difficult to be neighbourly pleasant and converse, great I thought this is going ok, then all of a sudden it changed.

My first proper encounter with Jasmine spiraled me back to days I don't want to remember. She embodied the co-dependant addicted personality I used to have. She found it almost impossible to be alone and she'd latch onto to me when her favorite's weren't there. It didn't take me long to realise she was the lord high chief energy vampire in the block.

It was early morning and she was still high from the crystal meth she'd been smoking all night, eyes dilated and jaw gurning, not a pretty sight, her boyfriend (or as she called him her ATM from England) had just set off to return to England. She walked into my apartment and started babbling, at first it was entertaining like watching a funny drunk when you're sober but as time wears on and they don't get a partner crime they turn a bit more unpleasant.

I politely declined to join her party, I wasn't going to seek out those doors to addiction again especially not with her. I was fresh blood for this energy vampire I was drained fully and quickly and it placed me right back to the feelings and situations of the unpleasant past, the ones I'd rather forget, those weren't good times for me and it triggered some old personality traits that lingered around and I couldn't shift (quickly anyway.)

I declined further invitations, but to be honest I didn't want to join in with their co-dependant boozed up gang and I'm not swallowing any of their bullshit mutterings. Accepting that first can of beer after 6 months dry, was only a hairs breadth away while in their company,  I could also sense deceit, betrayal and disappointment in their game. With my newer wisdom and foresight of probable outcomes I justified I was better off watching a movie than an evening caught in their cross talk.


This negative experience spun me way back but on reflection I'm glad I didn't sooth the burn with booze, the last time I did it took more than a month to get myself off it again.

As for the another trial maybe it's my money issues, I'm tight, I look for the cheapest deal, I used to scour the supermarkets for those price reduction stickers, find the cheapest hotel, etc etc.

But slowly I could feel the need to save money slowly ebb away, I still sort any internet search into low to high price but I look for value the best room for a lowish price.
