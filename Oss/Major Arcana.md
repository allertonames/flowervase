### 0 Fool
New beginnings. Optimism. Trust in life. Innocence. Creative dreamer. Spontaneity. 
The start of a new journey, a new life, a new beginning, a spirit quest. Stepping onto an unknown path as it unfolds before him, he travels from unconscious awareness, a blank slate of childlike innocence towards individuation and self-actualisation the bright sun lights the way. The mountains show he has many peaks and troughs to climb. The dog is a psychopomp, a loyal companion to guide him on his journey and will sound a warning in times of danger. The feather in his cap shows his divine nature/higher self and inquisitive mind, the white rose of pure spirit is only repeated on the death flag. His bag is closed it can carry anything and everything it’s behind him in his past and probably carries his old life, knowledge & experiences that will be slowly replaced with new ones throughout his journey. He has his head in the clouds but feet on the earth, he is a clueless magician. He can come full circle once the journey completes and starts out again into a bigger wider deeper universe.

### 1 Magician
Personal power. Creative Power. Intention. Autonomy. Willpower. 
Realisation of the individual higher Self and that there’s more to the material world. He must learn to live with a larger sense of Self and to balance the material and the immaterial world. The tools of the four suits are laid before him and he is surrounded by white divine lilies and red roses of passion, these are reflected in his white tunic of purity of intention and the red robe of purpose of will. He displays activation of the inner divine & higher mind with the infinity symbol above his head with his hands in the as above so below positions, his oroborus belt and white headband. Now he must master these tools & divine powers, become responsible for Self & actions to make his inner his outer and the World his own. These are the very first steps, seeing the contradictions in what you told to believe is truth and what your inner knowing and experiences tell you. 

### 2 High Priestess
Inner Wisdom. Ying & Yang. Spirituality. Going within. Subconscious. Balance.
As he grows he learns about the subconscious and enters the underworld, the soul, the dream world, the hidden, the anima his female side. She is Sophia, persephone, Isis, & Diana, she bridges the gap between the yin & yang, creation and destruction the black & white pillars or duality. A veil is hung between them with the pattern of the kabbalah There’s still much to learn before the veil is removed. She is the balance between the duality and this shows in her moon like crown and the central cross, she holds the book of wisdom & law in her hands and her robes look like the deep waters of emotion which flow onto the crescent moon. Learning of her knowledge is looking deeper at what lies within, at dreams and visions, at our subconscious our inner wisdom, intuition, not the monkey mind of worldly people and superficial things. This cannot be learnt while soaked in materialism, there is a need to withdraw, rest, as he process this emotional adjustment he will encounter painful memories & grieve the loss of former traits which can easily lead to self medication.
