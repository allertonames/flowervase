Did hemmingway like this place 

Theres a certain charm about the place.

I’m here in off season small groups of back packers pass through I’ve seen a couple of groups walking pass me a ouple of times theres only a few shops near  the front they pass later on a couple of times with a look of is that it they’ve walked all the sreets. 

The expat club is loyal to there regular hangouts. There’s only a few left after lots of places close for summer. 

I can see the bird nest house from my room, its a roof made form green corrugated iron, from here it looks fairly new perhaps they havest the eggs and sell them as quail eggs. But the birds flock arud the opening to I’m fascinated they don’t bang into each other. 
Well less amazed after being in a throng of moto bikes on a bangkok intersection all similarly manouvering just enough so as not to bump.

But there is a patterns to the circling spirling downwards a bit like a stack of planes waiting to land. 

It’s probably the quietest place for a small town that I’ve stayed. There is a core of year round business in and around the old market. Just one block over and empty shells or derilict beautiful french colonial town houses dot then complete the row. 

And it;s one block over that the tourist shops cafes and resturants close for the sumer. 

1 blcok back from the riverside and 1 blcok over to the left starts the knocking shops. 

A massage sign out front and during the day someone sleeping in a hammock ready to cater for a customer.

At dusk the night shift start, out front sit the ladies, they will give you a massage but thats not their main or prefered way of earning money. 

I’m surpirsed how many there are still open in what seems like a really quite town. Theres at least 6 all with 2 ladies sat out front. 
The houses are not much worse than some shops. Larger rooms partioned if your luck with a board – the ceiling usially stained form the leaks a sheet usualy covers it.
