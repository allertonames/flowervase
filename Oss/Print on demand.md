The Broighter Collar

But the most spectacular torc treasure of all, for detail and craft rather than sheer volume, has to be the Broighter Collar. A later, Iron Age piece thought to be from the 1st century BC shows how craftspeople developed and added new techniques to produce ever more impressive pieces. The intricate and highly decorative style of this collar is associated with the Le Tène culture that many think of as synonymous with Celtic design.

Indeed the Broighter Collar is considered one of the finest pieces of surviving Celtic metalwork anywhere in the world today. It is held in the highest regard, along side ancient Irish treasures like the Ardagh Chalice, The Book of Kells or the Tara Brooch.
