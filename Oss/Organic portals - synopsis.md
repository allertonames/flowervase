Boris Mouravieff points out that there are 2 races. 
Pre-adamic man and adamic man

Pre-adamic is the manof the 6th day. Blessed by the creator and told to go out and be fruit ful – lower centers of animistic in nature – (perhaps sentient like elephants)


Adamic man – created by jehovah to cultivate the fields – a slave race! 


My interpretations 
6th day man is referring to the original man from the planet part of gia has sentient is part of the planetary brotherhood dolphins, elephant, whales, orgautans. Reincarnates until he can reach 
Is truly divine in origin and has a connection to the pleroma has a concept of gnosis.  Seeks the truth and works to elevate their guiding spirit which in turn elevates the bodily reincarnation over time until they can leave the body and become a light being and go to that stage of conciousness evolution (what happens not sure but I can presume they become like gods and have to take a role in elevating the remaining conciness left behind) teaches to be humble and elevate them again to a the next level)

Adamic man Gen 2:5 talks of no persons to cultivate the land so Jehovah created adam. 
5neither wild plants nor grains were growing on the earth. For the Lord God had not yet sent rain to water the earth, and there were no people to cultivate the soil. 6Instead, springsb came up from the ground and watered all the land. 7Then the Lord God formed the man from the dust of the ground. He breathed the breath of life into the man’s nostrils, and the man became a living person. 

Jehovah is the demiurge ho thinks he could copy the creation but he breathed a soul into adam and adam went bad not beleiving JAH, thought he was a god. Maybe but had to go throught the process pre-adamic had gone through but Jah cocked up and missed a bit.
Down to Jah to destroy rebelious adam or but they still need a slave race. Kept a few and created a control matrix 

Problem is the pre0adamic man isn’t a servant but is caught in this control matrix 
The blue bloods are PRADM lets says and they pass this secret knowledge intergenerationally they tend to rise to the top and have become ruling elites.

Some and not born into the tight knit group don’t receive the leg up and struggle in life tryin to conform to the control matirx set up by Jah – there way out is by initiation into mystry schools like masons where the PRADM are ID’d and given leg up, through self knowledge study and esoteric work, becoming invincible as per chaos magic, intiated via sex magic – via heros journeys etc etc they might not get the full relisation in this life but will carry the self gained knowledge to the next and start from a higher level with more imunity to the control matrix

Adamic man has a soul and is capable of achieving the higher realms but there is much much more work for them to do. They first have to go through gia become the christ archetype. 
The matrix control system adapts to the baseline knowledge as more adamic become aware the control systems throws more at them they have to expell the same efforrt as always but adamics are starting in a system that has less religious dogma and persecution in some parts and if they still don’t take a step up they come back into the old style reliogous dogma ie. islam
