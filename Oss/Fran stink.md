Fran is dead, too much dog sex, full of caninie diseases, unsanitory, addeled in the brain with a 2 faced dog bark.
Actually BELIVES she gave birth to her lap dog and is a MOTHER.
 
Did marcus try suicide again - nightmare! 

blood debt payments overdue, archetypal haunting until debt is cleared

Trevor dead yet?
Why not do the same, you did to Jen? Not enough cash to embezzle from your dead dad.
SHAME.

Look, Its a Benn, shame the witch, spit in that face, utter disgrace

Extinguish all Benn bloodlines - the authority notified,  humanity needs greedy granny-bone vultures  Extinict.


Inform when your son's funerals are, sure to be soon. AFTER penny drops, of stinking Benn picking grannies bones clean, more like Carrion crow in a dress, not good enough to be classed as a Mother.

A Happy new year for all those Benn funerals, big blood debt owed.

Hard divorce still waiting. 

 Jen's stink clings to the plotters,  It will haunt every breath until they take their last.


Abandon Ship,  empty vessel married a stink witch and cannot leave, pathetic excuse for a father, horrid example, cannot face their own shadow.
Will watch their offspring die.
Listening to a dog sex wife barking, husband hate.

Hard divorce 
Hard divorce
Hard divorce

Massive ego 
Umittigated GREED
Leave humanity, 
 Benn prefers sex with animals and theivery.

Sheenahs stink raises to heaven, forbidden entry, divert to prison for Greed witches.

Makes normal people puke when hearing Benns speak dog breath lies about granny bone picking.

Global disgrace upon Benn face.

Pay your debt
Pay your rent
Pay the dividend
Face your own shadow
Pathetic excuses
you all stink of unpaid blood sacrifice.
